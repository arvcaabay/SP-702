1,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Alex K,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort, and I can't say enough positive things about my experience. First and foremost, cleanliness is a top priority at Daluyon. The entire property is well maintained, which added to the overall comfort of my stay. The beach views at Daluyon are nothing short of spectacular. Waking up to the gentle sound of the waves and being able to enjoy a breathtaking view of the beach and clear waters of the sea had a very therapeutic effect. What truly sets Daluyon apart, however, is the excellent service provided by their dedicated staff. Administrator Joyce is a true gem, always ready to assist with a warm and welcoming smile. Restaurant manager Rico and his team deserve a special mention as well. The dining experience at Daluyon was great, with delicious food served in a beautiful setting. Lastly, I had the pleasure of going on guided tours with Jimmy, one of the resort's tour guides. He was knowledgeable about the local area and was very accommodating and attentive. In summary, my stay at Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort was nothing short of amazing. The combination of cleanliness, breathtaking beach views, and the exceptional service provided by the staff make this resort a must-visit destination.

8,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Mattia De Nardi,"me and my partner popped up there just as a costumers of the restaurant and not the village because in the city there were no restaurants open till late. The place was beautiful and the waiter/waitress were present, even a bit too much. the food was delicious but im leaving 2 star because when we were choosing our food the waiter told us that the portion were for 2 people but the fish of the day, which i picked. my partner took the half chicken roasted (which was meant to be enough for two people alone according to what they said). but when the food arrived i received two tiny slices of tuna (was the most expensive item on the menu) without anything as a side. mesnwhile the chicken was just enough for my partner (who usually doesnt eat that much). Therefore i ordered some rice, but it arrived as soon as i finished my tuna. we paid almost 2000 pesos for being left hungrier than when we entered."
9,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Zac Cropper,"Perfectly positioned to visit the Underground River. The rooms were quite nice, all of which have a gorgeous view of the beach as they are all built in a line right on the coast. The restaurant was fantastic, the cocktails were all delicious and well thought out. If you're looking for a resort that can take care of whatever you need, this one will not disappoint Rooms: 4 Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights: Luxury, Great view, Quiet"
10,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Karen Bahrin,"The staff are very friendly, helpful and responsive. We are very happy with their service, from their beach facilities crew, f&b, reception, bellman...everyone we met was fantastic. They helped us with unexpected transport issues due to flight delays, our lost luggage, last minute birthday dinner, room service and requests. They were great in keeping us updated on our lost luggage issue too. They were also very responsive to our emails prior to our arrival. They were also willing to accommodate our dietary requirements as we do not eat pork. The food in the Pawikan restaurant was also tasty with a good selection for everyone. The grilled chicken with bagoong fried rice/java rice and crispy bangus were our favorites! The Pinakbet was good too. Their brewed coffee at breakfast was pretty good. You can order a from a selection of Filipino and Western items for breakfast while there is a spread of breads, jams, cereal, etc. They also serve fruit to your table at breakfast. I believe they only have a full buffet breakfast spread when there is higher occupancy. We were still happy with the breakfast selection even though it was not a full buffet spread during our stay. Really convenient location for the Underwater Cave tour and Zipline which are within walking distance. Far from the city (1 hour 30 mins by van) but we enjoyed the serene and quiet surroundings with the mountains behind us and the beach in front. The sea was clear, clean and lovely to swim in. The beach is also very clean. There are small neighborhood shops and little restaurants if you feel like venturing out for snacks/meals or personal items like slippers, toiletries, etc. We enjoyed walking along the beach even at night to get after dinner snacks. Coast guard and police stations are just nearby. We enjoyed their non-motorised activities (kayaks, standup paddle boards) very much and pretty much had the whole beach to ourselves. Some things in the room needed to be fixed but nothing major. Water pressure could be better. Rooms are very clean. Bed is comfortably soft, as we prefer it. Pillows are great! AC is nice and cold. We had the grand suite and loved having our own private pool. It can comfortably sleep 6 pax. The balconies are great to enjoy the scenery and natural sounds. Thank you for our enjoyable stay, Daluyon team! Noteworthy details: Their staff are excellent! Rooms: 4 Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights: Great view, Quiet, Kid-friendly"

13,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,John Skibo,"We honeymooned here back in 2014 too. The area took some storm damage but Sabang is still an awesome place. Daluyon is a great place to stay. Staff is awesome, the restaurant changed the menu a bit and no longer has the fried ice cream but still good food. Rooms: Awesome rooms in Hut style buildings and all with a great sea view. Nearby activities: Underground River and the Mangrove forest are nearby and worth a visit."
