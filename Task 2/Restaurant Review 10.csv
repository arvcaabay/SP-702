4,Pizzeria Roma,lucile jouis,"TO FLEE ! I never put bad comments but there I have to, do not rent a scooter from them! We are 2 French women, we wanted to rent a scooter, the restaurant lady ripped us off on the price and did not want to refund us the difference she owed us, even though we came back with the scooter earlier. On top of that the lady is very sour and not very friendly, first real bad experience, I do not recommend at all"

13,Pizzeria Roma,Mehdi Daroui,"Worst restaurant. No organization, I wanted to order a pizza and they made me go crazy for more than an hour and in the end just told me they couldn't deliver to my place. Better go somewhere else they will ruin your evening and waste your time."

16,Pizzeria Roma,Philipp,After a long travel day we found this little Italian gem next to our Hotel. The pizza was great and the owners super nice! You could see that they care about the food and happy customers - definitely can recommend
17,Pizzeria Roma,Pablo López,"The pizza is probably the best I had in my life, and I consider myself a person who had already tryed pizzas in hundreds of places. If you really look for a good pizza in Puerto Princesa do not even think it twice. Just go to Roma. I think I had 4 pizzas already in 3 days. And I will probably order one more tonight. It is simply amazing. Parking: I'm not familiar with Puerto Princesa, but with the motorbike it will not take more than 5-10 minutes to get there. The parking is good for your car or tour motorbike. Service: Dine in Meal type: Lunch Price per person: ?400–600"
