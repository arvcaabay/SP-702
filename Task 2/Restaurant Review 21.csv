2,Neva’s Place,Johnny TheWhite,"Fabulous ! It's a gems, not far away from the bay walk, there is Neva's place. They are offering Italians & filipino foods. The pizza is one of the best i tasted in the town. It's perfectly cooked, i suggest having the mozzarella cheese for the best experience. My girlfriend's chosen fried chicken and she said it was crispy and delicious too. Try it, you won't regret it!

3,Neva’s Place,Xia little Xia,"Pizza is really good specially when served hot! Staff are accommodating! We are welcomed and accompanied by a cute cat! He sat beside me and just stayed there!

4,Neva’s Place,Tiffany Hermans,"Had a pasta that was really delicious, but there are a LOT of mosquitoes here! So make sure you bring some mosquito repellent. I didn’t and my legs are covered in them (at least 26.. in a really short amount of time). Couldn’t really enjoy the food cause I was too busy with trying to keep the mosquitoes away"

6,Neva’s Place,Antoine Bellanger,"What they advertise and what they send are completely 2 different things! I ordered 1 beefy beef and 1 beef mushroom pizzas. I received 2 beef mushrooms, and on one of them, there was extra pineapple, which I did not order. Called the place, and the explanation I received is: the recipe of beefy beef pizza is the same as beef mushroom + additional pineapples... (and the guy over the phone explained the pineapple are the yellow triangles on the pizza... yeah... I learnt that a few years ago already...) Food: 1 Service: 1"
7,Neva’s Place,Meli C,We visited Neva’s place a couple days ago. Delicious food and the layout of the restaurant is beautiful. Tables all around a nice garden. The prices have increased since the last google photo on here (which is understandable since the photos are a few years old now) but the portions are a good size. I got the regular size pizza and it was like a large size. My boyfriend got the pork Milanese and he thoroughly enjoyed it and recommends it. The pizzas are stone oven baked and you can watch them make them from the seating area. I took photos of the updated menu for you all :) Service: Dine in Meal type: Lunch Recommended dishes: Pork Milanese
8,Neva’s Place,Wye Kit Teng,"So good that I came back for seconds! Beautiful little place in a corner street of Puerto Princesa City. Pizzas made fresh from a woodfired oven and classic Western dishes you'd find in Asia (chicken cordon bleu was great, pork milanese too). All at an affordable price point. Highly recommend! Service: Dine in Meal type: Dinner Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Recommended dishes: Chicken Ala King, Pork Milanese"
9,Neva’s Place,Howard,Delicious pizza and pasta. The all you can eat is great value. Set it a lovely tropical garden with a very nice open tropical design covered area for eating. Highly recommend.

11,Neva’s Place,Michael Maga-ao,"My all-time favorite local cuisine in Puerto Princesa since I moved here nearly two decades ago. The chicken Milanese and ala-king are my favorite, but they have pasta, pizza, and other local dishes that are so worth trying. The bucolic (as I perceive it) ambiance provides a warm and intimate feeling with whoever you're with. Service: Dine in Meal type: Dinner"
12,Neva’s Place,Julian,Was very tasty! Super crispy chicken and the baked bananas were also very tasty. The garden is beautifully landscaped and the staff super friendly and accommodating.
13,Neva’s Place,Romil Navarro,A big a** pizza
14,Neva’s Place,Rubin Phan,"Was acceptable, came quite later in the eve, had a few tables going. Local pork dish with rice was really good. Pasta dish was strange so we ordered pizza and left the pasta. Pizza was okay, more cheese would’ve been better. Service was a little slow but friendly people. Didn’t have bottled water. Prices are decent. Would come back for pizza and ask for more cheese."
