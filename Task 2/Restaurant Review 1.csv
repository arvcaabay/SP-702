Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Hans Suarez,Food is ok. Setting of the restaurant suits the simplistic life that it reflects mainly as a seafood restaurant
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,JAM P,"We are here about 10 years ago and again about 6 years ago. The first time it was an 8/10 second time 6/10 but this time 9/10. The food was really exceptionally good. We had tuna sashimi for starters. Very fresh with Japanese soy sauce and wasabi. Martin courses were blue marlin, prawn skewers and seafood sisig. The were presented beautifully and tasted even better. Service was great and the atmosphere wonderful. Not cheap but great value. Highly recommend."
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Glenn Tan,"It was our last night in Puerto Princesa and we tried this restaurant out of curiosity when we pass by. We ordered lato salad, tuna and prawn sinigang, sizzling squid, shrimps in garlic butter, whole coconut and mango shake. Fast service, great atmosphere and awesome foods and drinks. The seafood is very fresh! It was the best food we ate in Philippines by far~ If I come back to Puerto Princesa, will definitely visit again!"

Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Arte Postal,"If you are doubting whether to go or not, my recommendation is that you go. The price-quality ratio is adequate, and the service and location are excellent. The food was delicious. We (two people) ordered: the Blue Martin menu, which comes with soup, rice, seaweed and tempura vegetables; Shrimps; and the Tubbataha salad. To drink, two beers and two mango shakes, all 1496 pesos. They also serve cold water and the restaurant had fans."
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Alex Etxezarreta,"Really nice restaurant in Puerto Princesa, I could say the best one! Clean and calm space, with very tasty seafood. I would recomend it to anyone staying in Puerto Princesa."
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Philip Telan,I tried out of curiosity based on reviews. The food was what was expected from the reviews The place felt homey as you have to get in and lounge around on bare foot. It was sparkling clean. Highly recommended!!!!
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Kate Fan,"Very comfortable Filipino-style (?) space, the environment is beautiful, especially on rainy days. The service staff always listened to the needs with a smile and waited patiently for us to communicate in limited English. The seafood is very fresh, the seasoning is sweet but delicious. The juice of green mango + ginger is refreshing and goes well with seafood dishes. The clear soup after taking a seat is amazing, slightly sweet and gingery, which will not appear on the table of Taiwanese. The final dessert was too rich and sweet for us, but still tasty. Four cups of drinks, crabs, fresh fish, mixed vegetables, fruits, desserts, a total of 2,700 Philippine dollars. A happy dinner time that satisfies the taste and feels comfortable, is worth it!"
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Wex C.,Location is very accessible. They are known for their seafood dishes which are really delicious as they only use fresh ingredients and fresh produce. Ambiance is very relaxed and family friendly (need to take off your footwear before you enter) so I suggest you wear slippers to lessen the burden of removing and wearing your shoes. Place could be busy most of the time so don't go there when you're really hungry. But it's worth the wait. Making a reservation before you visit is highly recommended. I only gave 4 stars because they don't have a parking space.
