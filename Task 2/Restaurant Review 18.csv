1,Max & Bunny,Daniel Hall,"Very delicious food with top quality ingredients. The nachos are actually delicious, the first noteworthy nachos I’ve found in the Philippines. The beef Salpicao, it’s very delicious! It seemed like a small portion for the 1300p menu price but if you can afford it and want a treat, it’s very good. Staff is nice, very nice restaurant with other specialty ingredients and wines for sale."

19,Max & Bunny,,"The pasta was cold and tasted bad. Even the bread on the side was frozen inside. I fainted the moment I ate it. I handed my card when paying, but it didn't come back for more than 15 minutes. When I went to check it out, I was told that ""it can't be used due to a system problem"" without even apologizing. Even after the payment was completed, I couldn't have a conversation with him because ""I can't issue a receipt"". The atmosphere of the store is good, but the operation is too disappointing. If you have come all the way to Palawan, you shouldn't go to this store. Service: Dine in Meal type: Dinner Recommended dishes: Spaghetti Pesto"
