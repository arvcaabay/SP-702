1,Wines Cold Cuts Restaurant Cortes Albao,Ludo Nijsten,"Disappointed is what i can say.Not about the plate shortcuts we had but about the place itself.We had the shortcuts for 1400 peso.This was very good.But my meaning the sheap toasted bread is not my idea with Spanish tapas.I don't know where the people got the tapas pictures from on this page, you can't find them on the menu.The half of the place itself looks like a place in the back somewhere,with a fridge, fan,publicity board,a cooler or rubbish bin,boxes of beer.Those things do not belong in a restaurant to make it cozy.A pity."
