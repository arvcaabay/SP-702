12,Badjao Seafront Restaurant,Dee Swain,"A worthwhile eating highlight in Princessa. The place is a little out of the way but amazing setting. Mangroves on 3 sides, and bay/sunset facing to the front. Get there by 5-ish for a front table. Fabulous atmosphere / vibe! The staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. We both agreed that in order our favs were first fried shrimp, next grilled squid, then crab, then steamed prawns. The last three were part of the seafood platter. Not cheap, but delivers on value for sure! 2500php for two incl. drinks. Highly recommended for something special. See the photos of the restaurant / entrance, views and food.
