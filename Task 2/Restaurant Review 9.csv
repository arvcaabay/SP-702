2,Painted Table,Rina Ryan,Service was slow. Staff didn't seem to know what they were doing; took 3 people to make my mango shake. Food was terrible and portions were a joke. My partner and l also had LBM right after eating here.
3,Painted Table,Salvatore Alaimo,"Poor service, poor food. Not sure if the food is inspired to the Italian cuisine (as almost half of their menu has Italian plates), but definitely far far away from the proper italian plates we’ve got in my country."
4,Painted Table,Leslie Dunham,"The variety of food is incredible! I don’t know how they have enough space for all the ingredients to make so many different types of dishes and do it so well. You’ll for sure find a dish that suits everyone’s taste. (You can even ask for their secret Filipino menu). Customer service is top notch as well, at the level of 5 star restaurants. I highly recommend this place!"
5,Painted Table,Ulrika Forslund,OMG! Amazing ribs and the mango shake was superb
6,Painted Table,Roslin Dizon,"Service is great, but food is just average"
7,Painted Table,happyhani,nacho basket is the best!!
8,Painted Table,Boyan Dobrev,Really great place with wonderful service. Food is delicious and it feels like they use high quality products. Will definitely come back a few more times. Only too bad they don’t have alternatives to cow’s milk (suck as almond milk). And the wifi is painfully slow.
9,Painted Table,John Drummond,"Came here for our last night in PP. We heard about it via local artist Mark Garcia and had passed by the hotel a few times which looked attractive. The waiting staff were extremely attentive (personally too much for me at one point as I like to read the menu without being stood over). However they were so kind, knowledge about the menu and allergies and we overheard them being familiar with cultural differiences ie. No certain types of meat. Jerick tried to teach us some Tagalog and we had a laugh singing Sibbiana/Baby co. The venue was clean, querky and beautiful. We would have liked to see a drinks menu but remembered a cucumber lemonade from the reviews , perhaps we should have stuck to calamansi - it was nice but more like a green ice smoothie than traditional cucumber lemonade! I ordered pork ribs which came with corn and onion rings, my other half ordered chicken which came with mash and vegetables. Both thought food was exceptional quality for value and considering location. We bought a mango qusidia for desert (this did not look so appetising - see image- like green mould! But was tasty, similar to a thick crep) as well as spicy chocolate moose with merange which was delicious ( I had food envy)!!! No toilet roll in toilet but otherwise a great experience. Highly recommend."
10,Painted Table,,The personal was amazing
11,Painted Table,Claudia Baptista,Amazing food and super friendly and helpful staff!
12,Painted Table,Jessica Chiaraluna,Best shrimp tacos I’ve ever had. We went during the lunch rush so it did take a little while to get but they were well worth the wait!
13,Painted Table,Stanley Go,Their food was delicious! Ribs were soft and tasted amazing. Their portions for quesadillas and tacos could be a bit bigger but it was still filling nevertheless.
14,Painted Table,Mike Dela Paz,"Food is great, staff was super nice (special shout out to Sir John). Price of food is mid range but it really is worth it. Try their Jaladas Dinamitas & Flan de Casero. The place is just a few meters away from the airport so you can make this your last stop and then easily walk to the airport."
15,Painted Table,Maiah Viara,"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. I especially enjoyed the Basil and lemon drink. I love their appetizer Flauta Picadillo, wish it wasn't just two pcs. Oh and very good customer service."
16,Painted Table,Ana Maria Soriano,"Had dinner with my daughters here. We loved all the food that we ordered, from appetizers, main course to desserts. The fruit shakes were so refreshing with just the right combination of herbs. Service was also fast and great!"
17,Painted Table,Enrique Roa,My wife and I decided to forego the planned local grilled cuisine dinner and instead went by chance for Mexican fare. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the ingredients and in how well each dish was prepared. Painted Table is probably one of the best restaurants in Puerto Princesa.
18,Painted Table,Martina B,"Lovely tacos, tried 5 different ones and they were all delicious with well thought out flavors. Great watermelon smash too."
19,Painted Table,Kev O,"Food amazing, went there twice. Same experience. Staff very helpful, will literally to jump to assist you. Great decor, and great vibe"
20,Painted Table,Kristine Tsoulfa,"Best food experience in Philippines so far! Amazing tacos, and also the desserts are so delicious! We came here twice. My only comment is, that I wish they would let all the personnel taste all the dishes, cause I asked for recommendations for my dessert etc, and they couldn't say how it was because they hadn't tasted it. I find it to be weird for such a high end place and not all professional."
