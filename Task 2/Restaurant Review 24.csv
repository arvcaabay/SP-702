1,Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Troy Hunt,"The ribs were very good. I would order them again. The pulled pork was definitely the best deal. It was nice and moist and they give you a mountain of it. The baked beans were delicious—order them. The Mac and cheese, unfortunately, was the worst I have ever had. It was very watery. At first we thought it was a powder base due to the watery texture, but then I notice a shred of real cheese. Weird. Stay away from it though. Over all, a solid BBQ place."

11,Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Brad Carey,"Amazing food and Service.We nearly walked straight past this gem of a restaurant. Luckily the amount of people that were eating there gave us a great indication the food must be good and it certainly was.The staff were so helpful and very well spoken, they asked us our names and addressed us this way during our meal which has been the best service we have had in our 2 months travelling so far.We were served by a gentleman whose name I unfortunately have forgotten, and a lady named Lyra (sorry if it's spelled incorrectly). Both were very prompt in ensuring we were taken care of.The food! Oh please get the ribs if you're going there as they practically fall off the bone and the sauce is rich and tasty. My girlfriend got the vegetable skewers which were massive. I would definitely return, and I suggest anyone in the area to at least have a look and see for yourselves how great it is"
12,Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Brian Burns,The atmosphere was simple but comfortable. What separates this restaurant from comparable eateries in the region is the warm friendly staff and owners who make you feel special and welcomed.
