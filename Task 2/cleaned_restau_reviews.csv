Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Hans Suarez,Food is ok. Setting of the restaurant suits the simplistic life that it reflects mainly as a seafood restaurant
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,JAM P,"We are here about 10 years ago and again about 6 years ago. The first time it was an 8/10 second time 6/10 but this time 9/10. The food was really exceptionally good. We had tuna sashimi for starters. Very fresh with Japanese soy sauce and wasabi. Martin courses were blue marlin, prawn skewers and seafood sisig. The were presented beautifully and tasted even better. Service was great and the atmosphere wonderful. Not cheap but great value. Highly recommend."
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Glenn Tan,"It was our last night in Puerto Princesa and we tried this restaurant out of curiosity when we pass by. We ordered lato salad, tuna and prawn sinigang, sizzling squid, shrimps in garlic butter, whole coconut and mango shake. Fast service, great atmosphere and awesome foods and drinks. The seafood is very fresh! It was the best food we ate in Philippines by far~ If I come back to Puerto Princesa, will definitely visit again!"

Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Al Høknes,Nice atmosphere and quiet enough to be able to speak with the people at your table. Food is top notch. A must visit in PPC for sure.
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Kukie Bohrs,"Quite distinctive Sea grapes, fish, and even pillars have surprises."
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Sonny Dey,They actually serve the Ka Lui experience the quaint ambience! The foods serve are works of art. Vegetarian options: Lots of vegetarian options. Kid-friendliness: Safe for kids. Honey feeling.
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Anjel Es,The service and food was the best!! Great job!
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Arte Postal,"If you are doubting whether to go or not, my recommendation is that you go. The price-quality ratio is adequate, and the service and location are excellent. The food was delicious. We (two people) ordered: the Blue Martin menu, which comes with soup, rice, seaweed and tempura vegetables; Shrimps; and the Tubbataha salad. To drink, two beers and two mango shakes, all 1496 pesos. They also serve cold water and the restaurant had fans."
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Alex Etxezarreta,"Really nice restaurant in Puerto Princesa, I could say the best one! Clean and calm space, with very tasty seafood. I would recomend it to anyone staying in Puerto Princesa."
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Philip Telan,I tried out of curiosity based on reviews. The food was what was expected from the reviews The place felt homey as you have to get in and lounge around on bare foot. It was sparkling clean. Highly recommended!!!!
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Kate Fan,"Very comfortable Filipino-style (?) space, the environment is beautiful, especially on rainy days. The service staff always listened to the needs with a smile and waited patiently for us to communicate in limited English. The seafood is very fresh, the seasoning is sweet but delicious. The juice of green mango + ginger is refreshing and goes well with seafood dishes. The clear soup after taking a seat is amazing, slightly sweet and gingery, which will not appear on the table of Taiwanese. The final dessert was too rich and sweet for us, but still tasty. Four cups of drinks, crabs, fresh fish, mixed vegetables, fruits, desserts, a total of 2,700 Philippine dollars. A happy dinner time that satisfies the taste and feels comfortable, is worth it!"
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,Wex C.,Location is very accessible. They are known for their seafood dishes which are really delicious as they only use fresh ingredients and fresh produce. Ambiance is very relaxed and family friendly (need to take off your footwear before you enter) so I suggest you wear slippers to lessen the burden of removing and wearing your shoes. Place could be busy most of the time so don't go there when you're really hungry. But it's worth the wait. Making a reservation before you visit is highly recommended. I only gave 4 stars because they don't have a parking space.
Kalui Seafood Restaurant,George Aumann,They serve seafood and it tasted really good.

We both agreed that in order our favs were first fried shrimp, next grilled squid, then crab, then steamed prawns. The last three were part of the seafood platter. Not cheap, but delivers on value for sure! 2500php for two incl. drinks. Highly recommended for something special. See the photos of the restaurant / entrance, views and food.

Not to mention the salad was delicious and fresh. Soup was thick and had a lot of real mushroom bits, a tasty soup indeed. We both had the bbq pork ribs for our main course because it was their specialty. Meat was so tender and almost falling off from the bone. Bbq sauce was equally delicious. Just what I prefer for bbq sauce, a little sweet and salty. Ambiance was cozy and relaxing with soft music - just perfect for a dinner date. Waiters were very attentive.

Painted Table,Rina Ryan,Service was slow. Staff didn't seem to know what they were doing; took 3 people to make my mango shake. Food was terrible and portions were a joke. My partner and l also had LBM right after eating here.
Painted Table,Salvatore Alaimo,"Poor service, poor food. Not sure if the food is inspired to the Italian cuisine (as almost half of their menu has Italian plates), but definitely far far away from the proper italian plates weve got in my country."
Painted Table,Leslie Dunham,"The variety of food is incredible! I dont know how they have enough space for all the ingredients to make so many different types of dishes and do it so well. Youll for sure find a dish that suits everyones taste. (You can even ask for their secret Filipino menu). Customer service is top notch as well, at the level of 5 star restaurants. I highly recommend this place!"
Painted Table,Ulrika Forslund,OMG! Amazing ribs and the mango shake was superb
Painted Table,Roslin Dizon,"Service is great, but food is just average"
Painted Table,happyhani,nacho basket is the best!!
Painted Table,Boyan Dobrev,Really great place with wonderful service. Food is delicious and it feels like they use high quality products. Will definitely come back a few more times. Only too bad they dont have alternatives to cows milk (suck as almond milk). And the wifi is painfully slow.
Painted Table,John Drummond,"Came here for our last night in PP. We heard about it via local artist Mark Garcia and had passed by the hotel a few times which looked attractive. The waiting staff were extremely attentive (personally too much for me at one point as I like to read the menu without being stood over). However they were so kind, knowledge about the menu and allergies and we overheard them being familiar with cultural differiences ie. No certain types of meat. Jerick tried to teach us some Tagalog and we had a laugh singing Sibbiana/Baby co. The venue was clean, querky and beautiful. We would have liked to see a drinks menu but remembered a cucumber lemonade from the reviews , perhaps we should have stuck to calamansi - it was nice but more like a green ice smoothie than traditional cucumber lemonade! I ordered pork ribs which came with corn and onion rings, my other half ordered chicken which came with mash and vegetables. Both thought food was exceptional quality for value and considering location. We bought a mango qusidia for desert (this did not look so appetising - see image- like green mould! But was tasty, similar to a thick crep) as well as spicy chocolate moose with merange which was delicious ( I had food envy)!!! No toilet roll in toilet but otherwise a great experience. Highly recommend."
Painted Table,Claudia Baptista,Amazing food and super friendly and helpful staff!
Painted Table,Jessica Chiaraluna,Best shrimp tacos Ive ever had. We went during the lunch rush so it did take a little while to get but they were well worth the wait!
Painted Table,Stanley Go,Their food was delicious! Ribs were soft and tasted amazing. Their portions for quesadillas and tacos could be a bit bigger but it was still filling nevertheless.
Painted Table,Mike Dela Paz,"Food is great, staff was super nice (special shout out to Sir John). Price of food is mid range but it really is worth it. Try their Jaladas Dinamitas & Flan de Casero. The place is just a few meters away from the airport so you can make this your last stop and then easily walk to the airport."
Painted Table,Maiah Viara,"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. I especially enjoyed the Basil and lemon drink. I love their appetizer Flauta Picadillo, wish it wasn't just two pcs. Oh and very good customer service."
Painted Table,Ana Maria Soriano,"Had dinner with my daughters here. We loved all the food that we ordered, from appetizers, main course to desserts. The fruit shakes were so refreshing with just the right combination of herbs. Service was also fast and great!"
Painted Table,Enrique Roa,My wife and I decided to forego the planned local grilled cuisine dinner and instead went by chance for Mexican fare. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the ingredients and in how well each dish was prepared. Painted Table is probably one of the best restaurants in Puerto Princesa.
Painted Table,Martina B,"Lovely tacos, tried 5 different ones and they were all delicious with well thought out flavors. Great watermelon smash too."
Painted Table,Kev O,"Food amazing, went there twice. Same experience. Staff very helpful, will literally to jump to assist you. Great decor, and great vibe"
Painted Table,Kristine Tsoulfa,"Best food experience in Philippines so far! Amazing tacos, and also the desserts are so delicious! We came here twice. My only comment is, that I wish they would let all the personnel taste all the dishes, cause I asked for recommendations for my dessert etc, and they couldn't say how it was because they hadn't tasted it. I find it to be weird for such a high end place and not all professional."

Wines Cold Cuts Restaurant Cortes Albao,Ludo Nijsten,"Disappointed is what i can say.Not about the plate shortcuts we had but about the place itself.We had the shortcuts for 1400 peso.This was very good.But my meaning the sheap toasted bread is not my idea with Spanish tapas.I don't know where the people got the tapas pictures from on this page, you can't find them on the menu.The half of the place itself looks like a place in the back somewhere,with a fridge, fan,publicity board,a cooler or rubbish bin,boxes of beer.Those things do not belong in a restaurant to make it cozy.A pity."

Yung ac nila is defective ba idk basta all rooms are hot super init. I hope they will take actions on this kase we havent slept well and we woke up in the Middle of the night sweating s sobrang init. Anyhow the staff are friendly pero yung ac ang init sobra."

The Orange Gecko Tagua'n,Phil Fray,"If your looking for a Hotel with Wifi services available, as well as a all day restaurant within it for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, this is the place in Puerto Princessa City in Palawan. Modest Air-conditioned rooms boast a decent hot water shower, which comes with a fridge stocked with mini bar if you choose.. Live music available however time I was there pandemic altered that. The artwork and misc. Items throughout the lobby / bar/ kitchen are I remember being most intriguing, featuring local artist paintings, along with a true tropical feel which adds to this unique environment. Has an incredible pool which you can invite others to join for a combined day of eating and drinking poolside for a modest 500 Pesos per person daily fee. Which is the norm. throughout all the Hotels I've stayed at here in Puerto Princessa. Staff was very kind and helpful in orchestrating my needs as for me being brand new to the Philippines and area proved very helpful. Children friendly , with various games available for them. Along with a decent library to find a book to relax by the pool with. A full bar is available for adults also."

The pasta was cooked perfectly and there was SO much flavour in the sauce and the meat was high quality.I had the banana split with flambe bananas and nuts and it was DELICIOUS!! The owner came and said chatted a bit and was super friendly. All the food is made FRESH to order and I dont know about you but I'd rather wait a bit longer for fresh then stuff that's been sitting there all day! So sit back, have a drink, and relax waiting for your food. You're on vacation! Slow your life down a bit like the Italians do. At the end of our meal the owner came and dropped off homemade delicious Limoncillo!!! Highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for amazing pasta!! They had a bunch of other stuff on the menu including pizza but we wer totally in the mood for pasta so that's all we got. If it wasn't pur last night here we'd be headed there tomorrow 100%"
Olio e Basilico Ristorante,CR Castro,"Only 4 because the waiter didn't know what they had on the menu, and had to keep going back to check if what was on the menu was avail. Other than that it was amazingly good food. The ambience was nice as well."

Lale' Restaurant,Holly May,We are vegetarian and really enjoyed the Indian food we had. The cook caters to how spicy you would like your meal. We shared an Indian curry between 2 of us as the portion was big and it came with rice. We also had some flatbread with sauce as a starter and this was nice enough. Was a bit quiet but recommend a visit if you fancy Indian food!
Lale' Restaurant,manelyn bacsal,Good indian and thai food. And the service was fast.
Lale' Restaurant,Philip WB,"Quiet little restaurant with very tasty food. Not immediately apparent from the road, as it set back a little, although it has a huge sign. The roast chicken with the salad and rice was a little dry, despite the sauce, but nevertheless tasty. The beef curry was excellent. The sauce delicious. Definitely recommended.If this review helps, then please like."
Lale' Restaurant,Doc Dan,"Taste is more of a fusion of Mediterranean and Asian dishes. Must try dishes are: Pad Thai, Lassi, and Naan bread w/ tomato chutney."

Max & Bunny,Daniel Hall,"Very delicious food with top quality ingredients. The nachos are actually delicious, the first noteworthy nachos Ive found in the Philippines. The beef Salpicao, its very delicious! It seemed like a small portion for the 1300p menu price but if you can afford it and want a treat, its very good.

Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Alex K,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort, and I can't say enough positive things about my experience. First and foremost, cleanliness is a top priority at Daluyon. The entire property is well maintained, which added to the overall comfort of my stay. The beach views at Daluyon are nothing short of spectacular. Waking up to the gentle sound of the waves and being able to enjoy a breathtaking view of the beach and clear waters of the sea had a very therapeutic effect. What truly sets Daluyon apart, however, is the excellent service provided by their dedicated staff. Administrator Joyce is a true gem, always ready to assist with a warm and welcoming smile. Restaurant manager Rico and his team deserve a special mention as well. The dining experience at Daluyon was great, with delicious food served in a beautiful setting. Lastly, I had the pleasure of going on guided tours with Jimmy, one of the resort's tour guides. He was knowledgeable about the local area and was very accommodating and attentive. In summary, my stay at Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort was nothing short of amazing. The combination of cleanliness, breathtaking beach views, and the exceptional service provided by the staff make this resort a must-visit destination.

Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Mattia De Nardi,"me and my partner popped up there just as a costumers of the restaurant and not the village because in the city there were no restaurants open till late. The place was beautiful and the waiter/waitress were present, even a bit too much. the food was delicious but im leaving 2 star because when we were choosing our food the waiter told us that the portion were for 2 people but the fish of the day, which i picked. my partner took the half chicken roasted (which was meant to be enough for two people alone according to what they said). but when the food arrived i received two tiny slices of tuna (was the most expensive item on the menu) without anything as a side. mesnwhile the chicken was just enough for my partner (who usually doesnt eat that much). Therefore i ordered some rice, but it arrived as soon as i finished my tuna. we paid almost 2000 pesos for being left hungrier than when we entered."
Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Zac Cropper,"Perfectly positioned to visit the Underground River. The rooms were quite nice, all of which have a gorgeous view of the beach as they are all built in a line right on the coast. The restaurant was fantastic, the cocktails were all delicious and well thought out. If you're looking for a resort that can take care of whatever you need, this one will not disappoint Rooms: 4 Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights: Luxury, Great view, Quiet"
Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Karen Bahrin,"The staff are very friendly, helpful and responsive. We are very happy with their service, from their beach facilities crew, f&b, reception, bellman...everyone we met was fantastic. They helped us with unexpected transport issues due to flight delays, our lost luggage, last minute birthday dinner, room service and requests. They were great in keeping us updated on our lost luggage issue too. They were also very responsive to our emails prior to our arrival. They were also willing to accommodate our dietary requirements as we do not eat pork. The food in the Pawikan restaurant was also tasty with a good selection for everyone. The grilled chicken with bagoong fried rice/java rice and crispy bangus were our favorites! The Pinakbet was good too. Their brewed coffee at breakfast was pretty good. You can order a from a selection of Filipino and Western items for breakfast while there is a spread of breads, jams, cereal, etc. They also serve fruit to your table at breakfast. I believe they only have a full buffet breakfast spread when there is higher occupancy. We were still happy with the breakfast selection even though it was not a full buffet spread during our stay. Really convenient location for the Underwater Cave tour and Zipline which are within walking distance. Far from the city (1 hour 30 mins by van) but we enjoyed the serene and quiet surroundings with the mountains behind us and the beach in front. The sea was clear, clean and lovely to swim in. The beach is also very clean. There are small neighborhood shops and little restaurants if you feel like venturing out for snacks/meals or personal items like slippers, toiletries, etc. We enjoyed walking along the beach even at night to get after dinner snacks. Coast guard and police stations are just nearby. We enjoyed their non-motorised activities (kayaks, standup paddle boards) very much and pretty much had the whole beach to ourselves. Some things in the room needed to be fixed but nothing major. Water pressure could be better. Rooms are very clean. Bed is comfortably soft, as we prefer it. Pillows are great! AC is nice and cold. We had the grand suite and loved having our own private pool. It can comfortably sleep 6 pax. The balconies are great to enjoy the scenery and natural sounds. Thank you for our enjoyable stay, Daluyon team! Noteworthy details: Their staff are excellent! Rooms: 4 Service: 5 Location: 5 Hotel highlights: Great view, Quiet, Kid-friendly"

Staff is awesome, the restaurant changed the menu a bit and no longer has the fried ice cream but still good food. Rooms: Awesome rooms in Hut style buildings and all with a great sea view. Nearby activities: Underground River and the Mangrove forest are nearby and worth a visit."

Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Willem 67,Now more or less all Covid rules gone Daluyon have as well good food again.

Called the place, and the explanation I received is: the recipe of beefy beef pizza is the same as beef mushroom + additional pineapples...

Nevas Place,Meli C,We visited Nevas place a couple days ago. Delicious food and the layout of the restaurant is beautiful. Tables all around a nice garden. The prices have increased since the last google photo on here (which is understandable since the photos are a few years old now) but the portions are a good size. I got the regular size pizza and it was like a large size. My boyfriend got the pork Milanese and he thoroughly enjoyed it and recommends it. The pizzas are stone oven baked and you can watch them make them from the seating area. I took photos of the updated menu for you all :) Service: Dine in Meal type: Lunch Recommended dishes: Pork Milanese

"Kusinero's ""tacos and burgers""",Graeme Jenkinson,"So disappointing. ""Chilli Con Bruschettas"". 'Chilli' means spicy with a bit of a 'kick'. This had nothing. So bland. I asked 'where is the chilli?' Answer: 'Customers dont like it hot'.????????? It says 'chilli'. Dah."
"Kusinero's ""tacos and burgers""",Manny O,"Awesome. The tacos are massive and I didn't know it at first. I ended up getting three thinking they were as small as they come like in the US - boy was I wrong. They tasted great as well as the appetizers we ordered. The wings, sisig, and lumpia cheese sticks were really good! I recommend you come here if you're staying close by."
"Kusinero's ""tacos and burgers""",Damiano Maria De Simone,Expensive compared to other places. Portions are for kids. I asked for a burrito and I received 4 fishy-fingers-sized rolls. Completely disappointed.

Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Troy Hunt,"The ribs were very good. I would order them again. The pulled pork was definitely the best deal. It was nice and moist and they give you a mountain of it. The baked beans were deliciousorder them. The Mac and cheese, unfortunately, was the worst I have ever had. It was very watery. At first we thought it was a powder base due to the watery texture, but then I notice a shred of real cheese. Weird. Stay away from it though. Over all, a solid BBQ place."

Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Edgar Penas,"The reviews I saw were all very positive , but I find the ribs and pulled pork a bit too sweet for me ... The sweet ice tea was truly sweet sweet sweet ..."
Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Brad Carey,"Amazing food and Service.We nearly walked straight past this gem of a restaurant. Luckily the amount of people that were eating there gave us a great indication the food must be good and it certainly was.The staff were so helpful and very well spoken, they asked us our names and addressed us this way during our meal which has been the best service we have had in our 2 months travelling so far.We were served by a gentleman whose name I unfortunately have forgotten, and a lady named Lyra (sorry if it's spelled incorrectly). Both were very prompt in ensuring we were taken care of.The food! Oh please get the ribs if you're going there as they practically fall off the bone and the sauce is rich and tasty. My girlfriend got the vegetable skewers which were massive. I would definitely return, and I suggest anyone in the area to at least have a look and see for yourselves how great it is"
Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Brian Burns,The atmosphere was simple but comfortable. What separates this restaurant from comparable eateries in the region is the warm friendly staff and owners who make you feel special and welcomed.
Hen House American BBQ and Smoke Pit,Candy Wilkinson,"Due to a change of ownership of the business, the service was a bit slow than usual. Food is good. Place was a bit warm."

Lato Coffee and Restaurant,Kenny McGuire,"The images just show me with a cookies and cream coffee-free shake but we also ate here. The drinks were really excellent and there is free service water which is very welcome when there's so much sugary spray cream in your drink. However the food was not quite such a high standard. It was sufficiently decent to feed us fairly well but it's not why I would go here. The view is lovely, the scenario by the water is nice, the drinks are very good and the servers are professional and friendly. It's very good, but it's a bit overpriced and their food generally could be better for what we paid for it.

Lato Coffee and Restaurant,Sannyel Martisano,"I've been here a few times and tried ordering in Food Panda (delivery guy hasn't picked up my order for almost an hour), so I had to wait for like an hour and a half. I was gonna complain by trying to call their phone number here (but it's says wrong number), so I suggest maybe next time try to put the correct number for future use. Anyway, I'm glad that a guy (from Lato) called me explaining what the problem is regarding the picked up. Overall, I'm very satisfied - I ordered Bangsilog (without egg), so they put some fried banana instead (really nice). Mocha is super good as well (my request was granted - xtra hot, go, go, go!). Hahahaha. Thank you, Lato! Gow! Service: Delivery Meal type: Brunch Price per person: ?200400 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Recommended dishes: Sweet Chili Shrimp, Chopseuy, Adobong Pusit"
