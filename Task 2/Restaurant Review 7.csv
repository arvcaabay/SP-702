2,Tataboom Bar & Restaurant,Elzem Dinç Kirli,"Banana shake was very good. However, the portion of food was not satisfying. The chicken that came was very small. Unfortunately, we were not satisfied. Also, the soy sauce on the chicken was too much. Service: Dine in Meal type: Dinner Food: 3 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 5"

8,Tataboom Bar & Restaurant,Santhosh Sivanathan,We waited to long for food to arrive. After we asked the waitress it came one by one. Their fried chicken was not tasty at all and it was flavorless. They gave ketchup as a dip. The spicy squid was okay and their adobe was little better. They did offer potato wedges for free for the delay but we were full. Maybe they should’ve gave dessert or something.
