The first time it was an 8/10 second time 6/10 but this time 9/10. The food was really exceptionally good. We had tuna sashimi for starters. Very fresh with Japanese soy sauce and wasabi. Martin courses were blue marlin, prawn skewers and seafood sisig. The were presented beautifully and tasted even better. Service was great and the atmosphere wonderful. Not cheap but great value. Highly recommend."

The price-quality ratio is adequate, and the service and location are excellent. The food was delicious. We (two people) ordered: the Blue Martin menu, which comes with soup, rice, seaweed and tempura vegetables; Shrimps; and the Tubbataha salad. To drink, two beers and two mango shakes, all 1496 pesos. They also serve cold water and the restaurant had fans."

The service staff always listened to the needs with a smile and waited patiently for us to communicate in limited English. The seafood is very fresh, the seasoning is sweet but delicious. The juice of green mango + ginger is refreshing and goes well with seafood dishes. The clear soup after taking a seat is amazing, slightly sweet and gingery, which will not appear on the table of Taiwanese. The final dessert was too rich and sweet for us, but still tasty. Four cups of drinks, crabs, fresh fish, mixed vegetables, fruits, desserts, a total of 2,700 Philippine dollars. A happy dinner time that satisfies the taste and feels comfortable, is worth it!"

They are known for their seafood dishes which are really delicious as they only use fresh ingredients and fresh produce. Ambiance is very relaxed and family friendly (need to take off your footwear before you enter) so I suggest you wear slippers to lessen the burden of removing and wearing your shoes. Place could be busy most of the time so don't go there when you're really hungry. But it's worth the wait. Making a reservation before you visit is highly recommended. I only gave 4 stars because they don't have a parking space.

The place is a little out of the way but amazing setting. Mangroves on 3 sides, and bay/sunset facing to the front. Get there by 5-ish for a front table. Fabulous atmosphere / vibe! The staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. We both agreed that in order our favs were first fried shrimp, next grilled squid, then crab, then steamed prawns. The last three were part of the seafood platter. Not cheap, but delivers on value for sure! 2500php for two incl. drinks. Highly recommended for something special.

Not to mention the salad was delicious and fresh. Soup was thick and had a lot of real mushroom bits, a tasty soup indeed. We both had the bbq pork ribs for our main course because it was their specialty. Meat was so tender and almost falling off from the bone. Bbq sauce was equally delicious. Just what I prefer for bbq sauce, a little sweet and salty. Ambiance was cozy and relaxing with soft music - just perfect for a dinner date. Waiters were very attentive.

We heard about it via local artist Mark Garcia and had passed by the hotel a few times which looked attractive. The waiting staff were extremely attentive (personally too much for me at one point as I like to read the menu without being stood over). However they were so kind, knowledge about the menu and allergies and we overheard them being familiar with cultural differiences ie. No certain types of meat. Jerick tried to teach us some Tagalog and we had a laugh singing Sibbiana/Baby co. The venue was clean, querky and beautiful. We would have liked to see a drinks menu but remembered a cucumber lemonade from the reviews , perhaps we should have stuck to calamansi - it was nice but more like a green ice smoothie than traditional cucumber lemonade! I ordered pork ribs which came with corn and onion rings, my other half ordered chicken which came with mash and vegetables. Both thought food was exceptional quality for value and considering location. We bought a mango qusidia for desert (this did not look so appetising - see image- like green mould! But was tasty, similar to a thick crep) as well as spicy chocolate moose with merange which was delicious ( I had food envy)!!! No toilet roll in toilet but otherwise a great experience. Highly recommend."

Modest Air-conditioned rooms boast a decent hot water shower, which comes with a fridge stocked with mini bar if you choose.. Live music available however time I was there pandemic altered that. The artwork and misc. Items throughout the lobby / bar/ kitchen are I remember being most intriguing, featuring local artist paintings, along with a true tropical feel which adds to this unique environment. Has an incredible pool which you can invite others to join for a combined day of eating and drinking poolside for a modest 500 Pesos per person daily fee. Which is the norm. throughout all the Hotels I've stayed at here in Puerto Princessa. Staff was very kind and helpful in orchestrating my needs as for me being brand new to the Philippines and area proved very helpful. Children friendly , with various games available for them. Along with a decent library to find a book to relax by the pool with. A full bar is available for adults also."

This is the real deal Italian. Not the typical""Italian"" you get in the Philippines with weird sweet/suagry tomato sauce but the kind you get IN Italy!! My fiancÃ© had the Carbonara (which he said was the best one he's had) and I had the penne Bolognese. The pasta was cooked perfectly and there was SO much flavour in the sauce and the meat was high quality.I had the banana split with flambe bananas and nuts and it was DELICIOUS!! The owner came and said chatted a bit and was super friendly. All the food is made FRESH to order and I dont know about you but I'd rather wait a bit longer for fresh then stuff that's been sitting there all day! So sit back, have a drink, and relax waiting for your food. You're on vacation! Slow your life down a bit like the Italians do. At the end of our meal the owner came and dropped off homemade delicious Limoncillo!!! Highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for amazing pasta!! They had a bunch of other stuff on the menu including pizza but we wer totally in the mood for pasta so that's all we got. If it wasn't pur last night here we'd be headed there tomorrow 100%"

First and foremost, cleanliness is a top priority at Daluyon. The entire property is well maintained, which added to the overall comfort of my stay. The beach views at Daluyon are nothing short of spectacular. Waking up to the gentle sound of the waves and being able to enjoy a breathtaking view of the beach and clear waters of the sea had a very therapeutic effect. What truly sets Daluyon apart, however, is the excellent service provided by their dedicated staff. Administrator Joyce is a true gem, always ready to assist with a warm and welcoming smile. Restaurant manager Rico and his team deserve a special mention as well. The dining experience at Daluyon was great, with delicious food served in a beautiful setting. Lastly, I had the pleasure of going on guided tours with Jimmy, one of the resort's tour guides. He was knowledgeable about the local area and was very accommodating and attentive. In summary, my stay at Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort was nothing short of amazing. The combination of cleanliness, breathtaking beach views, and the exceptional service provided by the staff make this resort a must-visit destination.

The place was beautiful and the waiter/waitress were present, even a bit too much. the food was delicious but im leaving 2 star because when we were choosing our food the waiter told us that the portion were for 2 people but the fish of the day, which i picked. my partner took the half chicken roasted (which was meant to be enough for two people alone according to what they said). but when the food arrived i received two tiny slices of tuna (was the most expensive item on the menu) without anything as a side. mesnwhile the chicken was just enough for my partner (who usually doesnt eat that much). Therefore i ordered some rice, but it arrived as soon as i finished my tuna. we paid almost 2000 pesos for being left hungrier than when we entered."

We are very happy with their service, from their beach facilities crew, f&b, reception, bellman...everyone we met was fantastic. They helped us with unexpected transport issues due to flight delays, our lost luggage, last minute birthday dinner, room service and requests. They were great in keeping us updated on our lost luggage issue too. They were also very responsive to our emails prior to our arrival. They were also willing to accommodate our dietary requirements as we do not eat pork. The food in the Pawikan restaurant was also tasty with a good selection for everyone. The grilled chicken with bagoong fried rice/java rice and crispy bangus were our favorites! The Pinakbet was good too. Their brewed coffee at breakfast was pretty good. You can order a from a selection of Filipino and Western items for breakfast while there is a spread of breads, jams, cereal, etc. They also serve fruit to your table at breakfast. I believe they only have a full buffet breakfast spread when there is higher occupancy. We were still happy with the breakfast selection even though it was not a full buffet spread during our stay. Really convenient location for the Underwater Cave tour and Zipline which are within walking distance. Far from the city (1 hour 30 mins by van) but we enjoyed the serene and quiet surroundings with the mountains behind us and the beach in front. The sea was clear, clean and lovely to swim in. The beach is also very clean. There are small neighborhood shops and little restaurants if you feel like venturing out for snacks/meals or personal items like slippers, toiletries, etc. We enjoyed walking along the beach even at night to get after dinner snacks. Coast guard and police stations are just nearby. We enjoyed their non-motorised activities (kayaks, standup paddle boards) very much and pretty much had the whole beach to ourselves. Some things in the room needed to be fixed but nothing major. Water pressure could be better. Rooms are very clean. Bed is comfortably soft, as we prefer it. Pillows are great! AC is nice and cold. We had the grand suite and loved having our own private pool. It can comfortably sleep 6 pax. The balconies are great to enjoy the scenery and natural sounds.

I would order them again. The pulled pork was definitely the best deal. It was nice and moist and they give you a mountain of it. The baked beans were deliciousÂorder them.

Both were very prompt in ensuring we were taken care of.The food! Oh please get the ribs if you're going there as they practically fall off the bone and the sauce is rich and tasty. My girlfriend got the vegetable skewers which were massive. I would definitely return, and I suggest anyone in the area to at least have a look and see for yourselves how great it is"
