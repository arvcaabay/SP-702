6,CAPTAIN RIBS,Katrina Yap,"We love everything we ordered. Ribs were meaty, very tender and flavorful. The cordon blue is was not dry, unlike others we've tried before.

7,CAPTAIN RIBS,christine dufroy,Really delicious meal! Cocktails at the top. And a more than warm welcome! And special attention for my husband's birthday. A beautiful memory
8,CAPTAIN RIBS,Dennis De Vera,"My date and I ordered nicoise salad and mushroom soup for starters and we didnt expect their servings were good for sharing. Not to mention the salad was delicious and fresh. Soup was thick and had a lot of real mushroom bits, a tasty soup indeed. We both had the bbq pork ribs for our main course because it was their specialty. Meat was so tender and almost falling off from the bone. Bbq sauce was equally delicious. Just what I prefer for bbq sauce, a little sweet and salty. Ambiance was cozy and relaxing with soft music - just perfect for a dinner date. Waiters were very attentive. This restaurant is a MUST-try when you come to Puerto Prinsesa. Meal type: Dinner Food: 4 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4 Recommended dishes: Pork Ribs"

12,CAPTAIN RIBS,Breavis,"Coming from America, the land of slow smoked baby back ribs, I can say these ribs are good, not great. However, they are still probably the best in Palawan. The chicken cordon Bleu was amazing."
