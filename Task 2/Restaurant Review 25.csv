16,Lato Coffee and Restaurant,Kenny McGuire,"The images just show me with a cookies and cream coffee-free shake but we also ate here. The drinks were really excellent and there is free service water which is very welcome when there's so much sugary spray cream in your drink. However the food was not quite such a high standard. It was sufficiently decent to feed us fairly well but it's not why I would go here. The view is lovely, the scenario by the water is nice, the drinks are very good and the servers are professional and friendly. It's very good, but it's a bit overpriced and their food generally could be better for what we paid for it.

19,Lato Coffee and Restaurant,Sannyel Martisano,"I've been here a few times and tried ordering in Food Panda (delivery guy hasn't picked up my order for almost an hour), so I had to wait for like an hour and a half. I was gonna complain by trying to call their phone number here (but it's says wrong number), so I suggest maybe next time try to put the correct number for future use. Anyway, I'm glad that a guy (from Lato) called me explaining what the problem is regarding the picked up. Overall, I'm very satisfied - I ordered Bangsilog (without egg), so they put some fried banana instead (really nice). Mocha is super good as well (my request was granted - xtra hot, go, go, go!). Hahahaha. Thank you, Lato! Gow! Service: Delivery Meal type: Brunch Price per person: ?200–400 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Recommended dishes: Sweet Chili Shrimp, Chopseuy, Adobong Pusit"
