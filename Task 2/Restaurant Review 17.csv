5,Lale' Restaurant,Holly May,We are vegetarian and really enjoyed the Indian food we had. The cook caters to how spicy you would like your meal. We shared an Indian curry between 2 of us as the portion was big and it came with rice. We also had some flatbread with sauce as a starter and this was nice enough. Was a bit quiet but recommend a visit if you fancy Indian food!
6,Lale' Restaurant,manelyn bacsal,Good indian and thai food. And the service was fast.
7,Lale' Restaurant,Philip WB,"Quiet little restaurant with very tasty food. Not immediately apparent from the road, as it set back a little, although it has a huge sign. The roast chicken with the salad and rice was a little dry, despite the sauce, but nevertheless tasty. The beef curry was excellent. The sauce delicious. Definitely recommended.If this review helps, then please like."
8,Lale' Restaurant,Doc Dan,"Taste is more of a fusion of Mediterranean and Asian dishes. Must try dishes are: Pad Thai, Lassi, and Naan bread w/ tomato chutney."
9,Lale' Restaurant,jalal uddin,Curry was nice but the bread tasted off
10,Lale' Restaurant,June Castillote,"If you love Indian or Thai food, then you'll love the food that this restaurant serves. Your visit will not be complete until you've tasted their different curry dishes."
11,Lale' Restaurant,Cardi Benicia,The taste of the food is average and the place is not quite busy I was alone and later a couple came in around 8pm. Expensive compare to other places in town and waiting for your food : 45 minutes. So never again this place.

16,Lale' Restaurant,Tobias K.,"pasta was good but pizza very bad, some strange sauce on it"
17,Lale' Restaurant,Kyra Ann Dianon,"Lale's is our go to restaurant. One of the best restaurants in Puerto Princesa Palawan. Their Chicken Tikka Masala (in spicy, not in photo since we were so hungry ) and strawberry lassi are the best in town! Definitely worth a visit. :)"

20,Lale' Restaurant,Supriya S Chandra,"Tucked away is this jewel serving authentic Indian cuisine for throw away prices, the only Indian restaurant in the whole of Palawan. If you’re here try their dal and chicken curry. 10/10 will comeback and recommend."
