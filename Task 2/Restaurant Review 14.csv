1,The Orange Gecko Tagua'n,Zamboanga Homes Best,"We had a bad experience with this hotel, we check in together with 5 seniors, we book for 4 rooms and it was around 8k plus for 4 rooms, we haven’t sleep well because it was super hot as in mainit. Yung ac nila is defective ba idk basta all rooms are hot super init. I hope they will take actions on this kase we haven’t slept well and we woke up in the Middle of the night sweating s sobrang init. Anyhow the staff are friendly pero yung ac ang init sobra."
2,The Orange Gecko Tagua'n,Robin Gould,"I use this place for a location to work, relax, eat and use the pool when living in Puerto! Also stayed there one night! Rooms are very clean and beautiful! Food here always lovely! Definitely one of my favourite spots in Puerto!"
3,The Orange Gecko Tagua'n,Phil Fray,"If your looking for a Hotel with Wifi services available, as well as a all day restaurant within it for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, this is the place in Puerto Princessa City in Palawan. Modest Air-conditioned rooms boast a decent hot water shower, which comes with a fridge stocked with mini bar if you choose.. Live music available however time I was there pandemic altered that. The artwork and misc. Items throughout the lobby / bar/ kitchen are I remember being most intriguing, featuring local artist paintings, along with a true tropical feel which adds to this unique environment. Has an incredible pool which you can invite others to join for a combined day of eating and drinking poolside for a modest 500 Pesos per person daily fee. Which is the norm. throughout all the Hotels I've stayed at here in Puerto Princessa. Staff was very kind and helpful in orchestrating my needs as for me being brand new to the Philippines and area proved very helpful. Children friendly , with various games available for them. Along with a decent library to find a book to relax by the pool with. A full bar is available for adults also."

15,The Orange Gecko Tagua'n,,Sadly didn't meet my expectations. Burger was home made but frozen then cooked from frozen in a frying pan so was very greasy. GF had the vegetable lasagna which was cooked in a microwave so the pasta was rock hard.
