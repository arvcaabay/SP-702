13,Olio e Basilico Ristorante,Roselyn Venturi,Best Italian cuisine in Puerto Princesa City & romantic place.
14,Olio e Basilico Ristorante,Martina Cvitanovic,"Wow....had a BEAUTIFUL dinner here tonight! This is the real deal Italian. Not the typical""Italian"" you get in the Philippines with weird sweet/suagry tomato sauce but the kind you get IN Italy!! My fiancé had the Carbonara (which he said was the best one he's had) and I had the penne Bolognese. The pasta was cooked perfectly and there was SO much flavour in the sauce and the meat was high quality.I had the banana split with flambe bananas and nuts and it was DELICIOUS!! The owner came and said chatted a bit and was super friendly. All the food is made FRESH to order and I dont know about you but I'd rather wait a bit longer for fresh then stuff that's been sitting there all day! So sit back, have a drink, and relax waiting for your food. You're on vacation! Slow your life down a bit like the Italians do. At the end of our meal the owner came and dropped off homemade delicious Limoncillo!!! Highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for amazing pasta!! They had a bunch of other stuff on the menu including pizza but we wer totally in the mood for pasta so that's all we got. If it wasn't pur last night here we'd be headed there tomorrow 100%"
15,Olio e Basilico Ristorante,CR Castro,"Only 4 because the waiter didn't know what they had on the menu, and had to keep going back to check if what was on the menu was avail. Other than that it was amazingly good food. The ambience was nice as well."
16,Olio e Basilico Ristorante,Maria Alexandra Umali,"Homey, casual place with fine dining vibe. The hosts are very friendly and the food tastes great, and well worth the wait. Try the limoncello!"
17,Olio e Basilico Ristorante,Josh Keogh,"Hidden gem of puerto princessa! Nice relaxed atmosphere. Kept it simple with bruschetta, spicy pizza and a salad paired with a house red and couldn't fault the authentic italian flavour! Similarly priced to other restaurants in the area. Worth the detour. Molto bene, gratzi!"
