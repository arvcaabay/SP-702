4,KaJoels Inato Restaurant,Nikki Bautista,Very nice local restaurant offering delicious Filipino classics. Everything tasted fresh and well-cooked and I really love the ambiance.
5,KaJoels Inato Restaurant,Robin Feind,Went there with four people for dinner. Location amd dinner was great. Lot of Philipines were eating there and the prices are really good. Only thing was that the English skills of our service guy were not that good but I think in a town like Puerto Princesa that is also nothing you can take for granted.

12,KaJoels Inato Restaurant,Raymond Resoco,"Been here last May 2019. A couple of walk from the hotel where we have stayed. We have tried this restaurant for its crocodile sisig recipe which is very tasy and delicious as well. For me, the best time to eat here is during dinner because of its lighting which brings extra beauty to it. There is also a vocalist that brings good vibes to the restaurant. Excellent service as well."
