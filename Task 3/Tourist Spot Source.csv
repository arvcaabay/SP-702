Puerto Princesa Underground River,National Park,"5WVG+2J Cabayugan, Puerto Princesa, Palawan",Cabayugan,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,300,Viki P,"We were not sure if we want to go there as we thought it is little bit expensive for what you get. We also heard that it is crowded and you cannot enjoy the place. Do not believe those things! :D It was absolutely amazing. We paid 1700pesos with transfer from Puerto Princesa, the guide in the car was amazing and she was talking a lot during the ride, it was not just a regular transfer, it was really educational ride. We were told we have to wait 30 minutes and we could decide if we want to go to zipline or boat through mangrove forest (additional money however, mangrove was 350p, nice choice). Now at the place after those activities you are first going with boat on the sea to the place where is the entrance to PP UR, that is one crazy ride which we enjoyed so much. It was not crowded at all. We never waited longer that 10 minutes, it was super quick. The ride through the cave was sooooo nice. You have earphones and the only light inside of the cave is the light which is held by boat guide, so the natural habitat of the cave is not disturbed. There is strictly silence in the cave so you hear in one ear nice sound of recorded guide and the other ear can focus on the sounds of water and cave animals. There is huge amount of bats, wow. We didn't receive any kind of ""holy bat water drops"", but you are warned to keep your mouth closed (and wear clothes you don't like). :D They will take you something more than 1km inside, but I think it is enough. And the lunch after the ride was one of the best buffets I have ever had :D but this depend on the company you book with and I do not remember which was ours, sorry. Go and enjoy!"
Puerto Princesa Underground River,National Park,"5WVG+2J Cabayugan, Puerto Princesa, Palawan",Cabayugan,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,300,Joky80,This is an experience you shouldn’t miss if visiting Palawan. The start of the experience is either if you order a tour from hotel or travel agency or if you get to the Sabang pier by yourself. Upon arrival you need to register and will get you place in the queue and just wait for your turn. It’s usually around two hours waiting time but there are some stores and restaurants which you can visit meanwhile. The boat ride from the pier to the beach closest to the cave takes 15 minutes. After that you walk for five minutes and get to the cave entrance and the boats which will take you inside the cave. The experience inside the cave is super nice. There are many beautiful formations to look at and there are thousands of bats living in the cave which are flying around you all the time. You will spend approximately 30 minutes inside the cave before heading back the same way you came in. Don’t miss it!

Sabang is the closest town to this park. You can arrange transport through where you are staying or from some travel sites in the town. You want to make these arrangements at least a day before you go. The standard tour is about 1.5 kilometers. You can opt for a longer tour, but you will need to apply for permits at least 3 days in advance. This is a UNESCO world heritage site. So the tours are pretty tightly scheduled for the volume of tourists that visit. Taking a boat from Sabang with a tour group, round trip will take about 3 to 3.5 hours. So if you leave at 0730 you should be done by 10-1030. Do the early groups to avoid the tourists coming from Puerto Princesa, well worth it as the monkey's aren't up yet. I read some reviews that stated the park was a 20 minute walk up the beach from Sabang to reach. If you use your finger on a map, sure. It's a touch over 5 kilometers as the crow flies. finger travel on a map is the only way you'd make that time. If you want to walk up the beach you will need to swim, walk, climb to get there. Give yourself 2 hours or more. I opted for the 15 minute boat ride at 730 AM. Trip went just fine. The trip is worth it for cave lovers and people interested in stalactites and stalagmites. There's bats in the caves and the possibility of getting bat guano, bat pee, or miscellaneous stalactite juice dripping on you is high. I enjoyed my trip here and thought it was worth the entrance and boat fees to see, once."
Honda Bay,Bodies of Water,Dalampasigan sa Lungsod ng Puerto Princesa,Sta. Lourdes,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,300,TGB,"This trip took us to three of the islands around Honda Bay: Starfish Island (my favorite because I saw a lot of starfish whole swimming), Luli island (kind of small so not much to see, but this is where buffet lunch is served, included in tour price), and Cowrie Island ( stop here for more swimming, snorkling, massage, or just laying on the beach). We spent about 60 - 80 minutes at each island. I did not feel rushed at any time. Snorkling and towel rentals available at a small shop the tour van stopped at before our destination. There were 12 guests in our group which made the van cramped. They should limit the group size to 10 so we do not feel like sardines. ?? The water was murky at Luli and Cowtie but warm. I took this tour February 2020 and the weather was mild about upper 70 degrees Farenheit. When scheduling this tour, look for an email or text from the tour operator confirming pickup at your hotel. If you do not see one by the day before the tour I recommend texting or calling them to confirm. That is what I did to ensure no mixups with my reservation."
Honda Bay,Bodies of Water,Dalampasigan sa Lungsod ng Puerto Princesa,Sta. Lourdes,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,300,Judit R,"Honda Bay is a great place to see and try all the activities it offers. The tour I took was overall good, nothing extra tho. The hotel pick-up was a bit late, no information what so ever. On the way to Honda Bay we stopped at a shop to hire snorkeling grear and water shoes. They said this would be the only place you could hire this stuff, although, you could hire everything where you get on board for less price. I actually ended up buying my own water shoes, so I could use them the next days as well. First we stopped at Starfish Island. It is beautiful! We were one of the first boats to get there, so it wasn't busy at all. The sun was perfect and we found some starfish which made my day. Next we went to Luli Island where we had lunch. Well, I might be picky but that lunch was just not my cup of tea. The dessert was good tho. Unfortunately, after having lunch the weather turned quite cloudy, the water was a bit cold, so we couldn't really enjoy the time there. I must admit, the island was still quite lovely. Last stop was at Crowie Island. This was the best island but heavy rain hit as we got there. Given the fact you got wet anyway, I went swimming. The water was warm and perfect for swimming. We had the most time here (1.5hours) but unfortunately the rain didn't stop. I went back to Luli and Cowrie Islands 2 days later on my own, I have to admit, I should have done this at the first place! It was actually cheaper than an organised tour and I really enjoyed it. I tried banana boat at Cowrie, OMG, that was sooo much fun!! You can also try jet-ski but I haven't. Must be fun too I guess. Overall, Honda Bay is a nice bay with lovely islands, you must visit some of them if you are in Puerto Princessa/Palawan."
Honda Bay,Bodies of Water,Dalampasigan sa Lungsod ng Puerto Princesa,Sta. Lourdes,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,300,Alexis Rufus,"Nice day out but first 2x islands very touristy and limited snorkelling. Final stop at the reef was better with lots of fish, but sea very choppy as was windy (might be better on a clear day) and water visibility not great. The actual pickup and drop off took much longer than expected due to having multiple passengers, but met some nice people. If you like snorkelling, apparently El Nido much better, this felt like a bit of a “tourist trap”."
Ugong Rock,Geological Formations,"3VP3+PVV, Purok Pagkakaisa, Brgy, Tagabinet, Puerto Princesa, 5300 Palawan",Tagabinet,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,200,Joky80,"This is a nice experience for everyone – families or friends, young or old etc. Upon arrival you will see an instruction video and the you are equipped with helmet and gloves. After that a guide will take you up the mountain through a system of caves. Some parts are easy while some other are a bit tricky. But on the most tricky parts you will wear a harness and be secured from above. When you have climbed to the top you will have a nice view and the opportunity to purchase pictures taken along the way. Finally it’s time to buckle up to the zipline and fly down from the mountain. The zipline is not scary and is actually very comfortable. You can choose to lie down or sit and it costs 100 pesos extra too lie down. The whole experience will take maximum 30 minutes. The only negative feeling I had from here was that it felt like they wanted to get you through as fast as possible so there wasn't much time to enjoy the moment."
Ugong Rock,Geological Formations,"3VP3+PVV, Purok Pagkakaisa, Brgy, Tagabinet, Puerto Princesa, 5300 Palawan",Tagabinet,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,200,Trumpboyer86,"I visited slightly after the lunch hour and was the only guest there. The cave climbing was very easy and there is someone pulling you up from the top, so you don't need much effort. There is a need to squeeze between rock formation, so not suitable for body size above 120kg. Once at the top, you can decide on the following: 1) Walk down the ugong rock 2) sitting Zipline (not allowed to carry any phone/camera as you need to hold on to the ropes) 3) Superman Zipline (you can carry your phone for photos and videos) In both ziplines, there is a professional photographer taking a few photos of you from far. You can buy a print-out photo at 200p or get the full set of digital photos for 200p (they accept android phone for cable transfer)."
Ugong Rock,Geological Formations,"3VP3+PVV, Purok Pagkakaisa, Brgy, Tagabinet, Puerto Princesa, 5300 Palawan",Tagabinet,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,200,Katherine D,"Not too strenuous, and lots of fun with photo zones that they take pictures of. A small walk through the trees and a small cave-like structure. We went ahead and bought photos of us on the rock climb and the zipline because they looked great. I recommend this as a short stop on your trip. Hopefully your group members don't rush you too much."
Firefly Watching,Nature and Wildlife Areas,"Puerto Princesa South Road, Puerto Princesa, Palawan",Iwahig,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,600,Greg P,"Really something special - cameras are more or less pointless, nothing will capture the magic of seeing trees lit up with fireflies at night with only the sounds of nature and your guide’s oar gliding through the water."
Firefly Watching,Nature and Wildlife Areas,"Puerto Princesa South Road, Puerto Princesa, Palawan",Iwahig,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,600,Renato G,"The firefly tour was well organized including hotel pick up and drop off. Nice and funny guide. The boat tour, especially on the river was so peaceful and since I never saw fireflies before, I actually enjoyed it. "
Firefly Watching,Nature and Wildlife Areas,"Puerto Princesa South Road, Puerto Princesa, Palawan",Iwahig,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,600,Czar Emmanuel,"This is one activity you can do at Puerto Princesa as soon as the sun sets. There are many travel agencies that can organize it for you. It is best to go firefly watching when the moon is not out. The darker it is, the better, since in this way you can appreciate more the flickering lights of the insects. The boat ride through the mangroves is also quite romantic. The darkness, the silence, and the lights produced by the fireflies all create such a romantic atmosphere! Highly recommended!"
Nagtabon Beach,Beaches,"Puerto Princesa, Palawan",Bacungan,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,10,palawanismyhome,The first time i went to Nagtabon Beach was 25 years ago when the only way to get there was riding on the daily jeepney along a rough road which sometimes took up to 4 hours for the 30 km trip.

I work in a brewery back in the UK so was excited to see one in Puerto Princesa. The reviews for the beers looked great. When we got there I was slightly disappointed that the beers I wanted to try were out... The IPA had such a good write up but there was none. I know it’s only a small brewery so it’s hard to always have everything available. Still slightly disappointed though. We had the Palawan Honey Kölsch and the Batak Warrior IPA (imperial). Only in bottles, not sure if they do any on tap? Beers were ok, well brewed in my opinion. Maybe I’ll get to try next time if I visit!"
Palaweno Brewery,Breweries,"82 Manalo St, Puerto Princesa, 5300 Palawan",Model,Puerto Princesa,Palawan, -   ,Natalie S,Stopped in here interested in trying some local beers.

Palawan Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center,Nature and Wildlife Areas,"QMXV+FRF, Puerto Princesa South Road, Puerto Princesa, Palawan",Irawan,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,40,Katy Santos,"Our first destination is the Palawan Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center which is a home of not just crocodiles but other species such as birds, reptiles, and many others. This place is a research and rescue center for endangered species. We were welcomed outside with so many souvenir shops that sell crocodile balloons for kids and other colorful souvenir items. This place highlights huge crocs which are the Philippine Freshwater Crocodiles and the Saltwater Crocodiles. The tour starts in an exhibition hall where you’ll see a huge and long croc skeleton and its skin until you reach the hatchling area where baby crocs are located. There are a lot of baby crocs placed in white tubs where they’re being fed and kept. As you walked further, you’ll notice that the shape and size of these crocs grow further until you reach the den of adult crocs where you’ve to walk on an iron trail above the crocodiles where they’re caged and fed. At the end of the croc farm, you’ll be given a chance to hold a young croc and have a photoshoot, don’t worry as the mouth of the croc is sealed with tape. You have an option to have the photos printed out with a certain fee or ask them to take a photo of you using your camera or mobile phone.Afterward, you can walk at the back of the area where a mini zoo is located. The place looks a bit dingy which needs a lot of renovation. You’ll get to see aviaries of mynahs, parrots, and hornbills. Reptiles and other mammals are also being kept in captivity of this Nature Park, I didn’t go further as we were only given a limited time to tour around the area."

Palawan Environmental Enforcement Museum,Specialty Museum,"QQ72+V96, Barangay San Pedro, Puerto Princesa, Palawan",San Pedro,Puerto Princesa,Palawan,20,madtown37,"This impromptu museum is situated in and around the offices of the Palawan NGO Network, an organization that has been working on behalf of social and environmental justice in Palawan since 1991. In recent years, PNNI staff and volunteers have confiscated an astonishing array of chain saws, compressors, boats, trucks, drilling rigs, cages, and other equipment allegedly involved in illegal resource extraction and wildlife trafficking, much of it owned by powerful interests. I have much respect for these brave souls. Visitors to Puerto should stop in, offer a donation, and learn about the reality of environmental politics in Palawan---there's a lot more to the story than eco-tourism and conservation."

Beautifully dressed lady in golden dress and shawl which showed off the pearls perfectly. Free to try on necklaces and bracelets. Friendly staff. Photos welcome. This gave us an impression of Palawan island so I would visit the museum if we had more time.

Please don't go as they have moved to Robinson's shopping centre . It's now just a retail shop and very expensive . Bought earrings there only to see them at half the price in Delma pearl shop beside Canvas hotel.
