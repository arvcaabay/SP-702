4,Carpe Diem Villas & Resort,Barry, United Kingdom,"Liked · The room, restaurant and facilities were very good.
Although appearing to be a little off the beaten track, it was only a short tricycle ride to a major shopping center and beach"
5,Carpe Diem Villas & Resort,Linda, United Kingdom,"Liked · We loved absolutely everything about this property. The rooms are beautiful and well equipped with fridge, kettle and complimentary water, tea, coffee and toiletries. The pool is perfect and each room has its own terrace with chairs and your own steps down into the pool. Food can be served in the room or in the restaurant. The surroundings are equally beautiful with paths through lush vegetation and statues. We really enjoyed staying here and wished we could have stayed longer. The staff were lovely too, very friendly and helpful and were fab at organising transport for us, and also chased when the bus was late because the driver forgot to pick us up - all resolved quickly by the receptionist without us saying a word!"

We had a unit with a deep bathtub and it was so nice to soak after a hot Philippines day. The decor is beautifully arranged, the pool is immaculate, the service is exceptional and the staff are so friendly and helpful even more than average Philippines. I can't give enough praise for this place. I will definitely return here if and when we visit Palawan.

18,Carpe Diem Villas & Resort,Veller, Bulgaria,"Liked · The staff are super friendly and helpful, the restaurant is not too bad, the garden is nice and so are the rooms, clean and quite pretty. The swimming pool and the pool bar looked nice.

Disliked · In just one night there wasn't anything to dislike, the whole resort was pleasant, I just can't imagine spending days there, cause there is nothing around, but it could be that I just missed whatever was to see because we were in a hurry ???????"

Disliked · The location in booking dot com is not correct. It is atleast 200 mts more inside."
20,Carpe Diem Villas & Resort,Amalina, Singapore,"Liked · They decorated the room beyond my expectations without any extra charge. Clean room too. Staff are friendly and extremely helpful to our needs. Was greeted by the owner upon checkedin. Nice lady.

Disliked · No space for luggage storage. Quite ulu location. Villa also has no light at the paveway at night.. so it’s very dark to go to our room. The safety and security of the villa also seems doubtful as there’s no gates.. just open concept which seems easy for anyone to break in."
