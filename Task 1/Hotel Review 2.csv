1,Vellago Resort (El Nido),Celestine, Australia,"Liked · First of all, the Vellago team was simply outstanding!!! We got an amazing welcome by Krisha and Angelo and the team, the breakfast in room, the room service, the amazing bar and restaurant employees, everyone was simply awesome, available, and helpful with a big smile! I will honestly miss everyone (thank you to the entire team (sorry I don’t recall all the names but everyone was great!).
Regarding amenities, everything else was also perfect! We were staying in the Honeymoon Suite and the suite had honestly the most beautiful view that someone would imagine! The room was clean, lots of good quality amenities, everything you need to spend a beautiful stay!
Big hugs and kisses to the entire team, to the little dogs that were so cute, and our little Gecko that we sang together with ??!"

6,Vellago Resort (El Nido),David, United Kingdom,"Liked · I don't often write reviews but I had no choice but I felt compelled.
First of all I want to say the staff make this place exceptional, the effort and service goes far beyond what it should.
The photos on booking.com do not even come close to the beauty of this place, when you ride in on the boat which is the only way to access the resort, you will soon come to realise you made a superb choice.
There are only 5 bungalow style rooms at this resort, we stayed in the deluxe sea view room with the hanging egg chair for two nights, and then swiftly tried to book a further 3 nights but had to settle for one of the other rooms as it was booked, but they too are beautiful.
The effort put into the ambience and landscaping leading into the bungalows is Bali like, with a Buddhist feel, it's beautiful beyond words, it's magical.
We were lucky to have the whole hotel to ourselves the first two nights and the staff went to an amazing effort to make us our evening meal on the beach, the staff really do go above and beyond.
The darkness of what actually feels like an island, as it's shut off from the mainland makes the stars at night burst out, so beach walks with your partner are extra special! ( You will also have your own personal security guard in the form of the one of the resort dogs who will escort you up and down the beach???? Two sausage dogs max and Bella, and two island dogs, they are all so lovey and friendly) it was like a home from home.
The beach hosts tours from the mainland throughout the day at the lower end of the beach, so you get the occasional tourist looking to take some photos of the resort as it's very picturesque, but once the sun sets ( which you have a premium view of here ) you are alone on the beach/resort.
if you are looking for that desert island feel, this is the place.
Thank you all so much, matamang salamat po.

Disliked · Hard to find anything, but I guess my only disappointment was that other than the main deluxe room, all of the rooms do not have a door on the toilet/shower and has no extractor fan and all have large windows into the bedroom, so privacy using the bathroom is zero, I asked the staff to place a curtain for us.
I know this is trivial and won't bother most, but some things should remain private?? ????
The other thing to consider is this is the tropics so you will see bugs, ants, snakes and spiders just like the mainland of which we seen most days, especially if your looking for them haha."

8,Vellago Resort (El Nido),Laura, United Kingdom,"Liked · If you are looking for a secluded, romantic getaway, I can highly recommend Vellago Resort. The staff went above and beyond in every way. They tidy the room every time you leave, bring breakfast to your terrace, and arrange the daybeds at the beach for you. Everyone there went out of their way to make sure we had a nice stay. The wifi in the room is good and the food is delicious. Since there are only a handful of rooms, you really feel like you have the whole place to yourself. If you are planning a trip to El Nido , you cannot miss this place!"

Disliked · It would have been nice to have more privacy for the bathroom/shower area."
10,Vellago Resort (El Nido),Celestine, Australia,"Liked · The staff were so accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Your receive a very boutique and personalised experience which makes the privacy of the area and resort even the more special. The location is just beautiful and tucked away, so it’s very peaceful. Initially when booking I thought the outlay/cost was expensive for the country, but now that we have been I would happily pay it again for the relaxation we got. When we have such busy lives it was easily the absolute best relaxation holiday we have had. We really enjoyed the boutique experience. It was exactly as described and would love to go again.

Disliked · It isn’t a resort with all the amenities like pool etc, but I think with the staff/service/tranquility and not having all those people around it was even better and you don’t really care. The beach is magic and our room had a bath and the day beds so it was exactly what we were looking for and as described."

17,Vellago Resort (El Nido),Mark, United Kingdom,"Liked · The staff and the owners were so kind, warm, hospitable, respectful, and thoughtful. The staff were exceptionally professional but still warm and sweet. The owners did above and beyond in organising a last minute short trip to the lagoons for us with champagne and sunset as a treat for our anniversary. We felt so special!
The rooms we had was the honeymoon suite and it exceeded our expectations. The photos online do not do it justice. It was bohemian chic/ luxury and very romantic. The room and the surroundings are very clean and fresh. We will definitely visit again! ??"
