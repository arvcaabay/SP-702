15,Corto del Mar Hotel,Michael, New Zealand,"Liked  The hotel is like a big private walled retreat (with a large pool in the middle) at the edge of the town. It뭩 within easy walking distance of the centre and restaurants, and convenient for island hopping or diving trips. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The reception staff are just wonderful, and make the visit very pleasant. I rebooked there on my return to Coron from el nido a few days later.

Disliked  It뭩 a bit of an art (which I didn뭪 fully master) getting the shower temperature right."
16,Corto del Mar Hotel,Josel, Qatar,"Liked  Everything in the Hotel I liked. The location pool, rooms, breakfast, views.

18,Corto del Mar Hotel,Gal, Czech Republic,"Liked  Lovely and cozy place in the Center on Coron surrounded by the hectic vibe of Coron but gives you a peaceful place to sleep, dine and relax"
19,Corto del Mar Hotel,Cathy, Philippines,"Liked  What made us return to this romantic hotel is not just the wonderfully clever and detailed design of the hotel itself, it뭩 also the friendly team and the cleanliness. The team always seems to aim (and achieve) to go above and beyond by taking their time to learn about your plans and finding ways to assist. We casually told of our plans to take a ferry to El Nido upon check-out and the next morning we were informed that transport to the ferry would be ready. We did not even tell them at what time we would leave but they planned it spot-on. The ladies truly know how to anticipate the needs of their guests. The service at the bar/restaurant is good, especially combined with the meals and drinks they deliver.
Our favorite hotel on one of the most beautiful islands we have seen on our travels."
