Cauayan Island Resort and Spa (El Nido),Eric, France,"Liked · Dear Cauayan Resort in El Nido, Palawan,
We want to express our deep gratitude for the warm welcome and exceptional kindness of the staff during our stay. Your hospitality truly made our experience, making our stay unforgettable.
The island itself is a true paradise. The natural beauty surrounding us was breathtaking, leaving us in awe of the splendor of every sunrise and sunset. Every corner of the island seemed to be painted by natures hand.
The dining experience was a memorable culinary journey. The international variety and freshness of the produce delighted our taste buds at every meal. Each dish was a delight that reflected authenticity and care in the cuisine.
We look forward to returning to this piece of paradise and reliving these precious moments. Thank you for everything you did to make our stay unforgettable."

The rooms were clean and comfortable and the beach and pool were amazing. also the staff were wonderful - so kind, attentive and helpful. They offered to carry our sleeping 3 year old down from the sunset hike when she fell asleep!! We also enjoyed the snorkelling options - snorkelled with a turtle and baby reef sharks which was really cool.

Disliked · As it is on an island it is costly to get off the island to see Palawan. I would maybe consider offering shuttle transfers maybe with pick ups to those staying there as an option"
Cauayan Island Resort and Spa (El Nido),Jose, United Kingdom,"Liked · Incredible value for money. Hard to match location, staff were always very friendly, flexible and helpful.

I will honestly miss everyone (thank you to the entire team (sorry I dont recall all the names but everyone was great!).
Regarding amenities, everything else was also perfect! We were staying in the Honeymoon Suite and the suite had honestly the most beautiful view that someone would imagine! The room was clean, lots of good quality amenities, everything you need to spend a beautiful stay!

Vellago Resort (El Nido),David, United Kingdom,"Liked · I don't often write reviews but I had no choice but I felt compelled.
First of all I want to say the staff make this place exceptional, the effort and service goes far beyond what it should.
The photos on booking.com do not even come close to the beauty of this place, when you ride in on the boat which is the only way to access the resort, you will soon come to realise you made a superb choice.
There are only 5 bungalow style rooms at this resort, we stayed in the deluxe sea view room with the hanging egg chair for two nights, and then swiftly tried to book a further 3 nights but had to settle for one of the other rooms as it was booked, but they too are beautiful.
The effort put into the ambience and landscaping leading into the bungalows is Bali like, with a Buddhist feel, it's beautiful beyond words, it's magical.
We were lucky to have the whole hotel to ourselves the first two nights and the staff went to an amazing effort to make us our evening meal on the beach, the staff really do go above and beyond.
The darkness of what actually feels like an island, as it's shut off from the mainland makes the stars at night burst out, so beach walks with your partner are extra special! ( You will also have your own personal security guard in the form of the one of the resort dogs who will escort you up and down the beach???? Two sausage dogs max and Bella, and two island dogs, they are all so lovey and friendly) it was like a home from home.
The beach hosts tours from the mainland throughout the day at the lower end of the beach, so you get the occasional tourist looking to take some photos of the resort as it's very picturesque, but once the sun sets ( which you have a premium view of here ) you are alone on the beach/resort.
if you are looking for that desert island feel, this is the place.
Thank you all so much, matamang salamat po.

Disliked · Hard to find anything, but I guess my only disappointment was that other than the main deluxe room, all of the rooms do not have a door on the toilet/shower and has no extractor fan and all have large windows into the bedroom, so privacy using the bathroom is zero, I asked the staff to place a curtain for us.
I know this is trivial and won't bother most, but some things should remain private?? ????
The other thing to consider is this is the tropics so you will see bugs, ants, snakes and spiders just like the mainland of which we seen most days, especially if your looking for them haha."
Vellago Resort (El Nido),Evelyn, United States of America,"Liked · we loved everything from the hotel, it is an incredible hotel with beautiful views and outstanding comfort. The beach is great, staff was amazing."
Vellago Resort (El Nido),Laura, United Kingdom,"Liked · If you are looking for a secluded, romantic getaway, I can highly recommend Vellago Resort. The staff went above and beyond in every way. They tidy the room every time you leave, bring breakfast to your terrace, and arrange the daybeds at the beach for you. Everyone there went out of their way to make sure we had a nice stay. The wifi in the room is good and the food is delicious. Since there are only a handful of rooms, you really feel like you have the whole place to yourself. If you are planning a trip to El Nido , you cannot miss this place!"

Disliked · It would have been nice to have more privacy for the bathroom/shower area."
Vellago Resort (El Nido),Celestine, Australia,"Liked · The staff were so accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Your receive a very boutique and personalised experience which makes the privacy of the area and resort even the more special. The location is just beautiful and tucked away, so its very peaceful. Initially when booking I thought the outlay/cost was expensive for the country, but now that we have been I would happily pay it again for the relaxation we got. When we have such busy lives it was easily the absolute best relaxation holiday we have had. We really enjoyed the boutique experience. It was exactly as described and would love to go again.

Disliked · It isnt a resort with all the amenities like pool etc, but I think with the staff/service/tranquility and not having all those people around it was even better and you dont really care. The beach is magic and our room had a bath and the day beds so it was exactly what we were looking for and as described."

Vellago Resort (El Nido),Daniel, Germany,"Liked · This resort is just exceptional and special.

Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Frank, United States of America,"Liked · Amazing location. How can you not love a private island? Decent snorkeling right from the beaches, great villas on the beach, good food, welcome foot rub! The Coron tour was fantastic I would recommend it to anyone. The animals were really cool to see, even if they scared us a couple times lol.

Disliked · The spa was just ok. The massage itself was great but the inside was hot and they didn't have a pillow to put under your feet so my ankles were hurting pretty bad by the end of it."
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Marqes, Philippines,"Liked · The staff and service were amazing, awesome presentation, welcome drinks, afternoon snacks, toiletries....
Amazing view, sadly we didnt get to do any water activities this trip.

Disliked · Breakfast was great!! But for the price of the food, food could do some improvements, more selections too..."

Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Debbie, Germany,"Liked · great location, service is top notch, quiet, and brings you pretty close to nature. the island is beautiful with perfect emerald waters despite the sun not fully showing up! the villa is lux and we get to enjoy a free foot spa!

Disliked · not like is a strong word, the food taste could be better. don't get me wrong it is still good"
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Wesley, United Kingdom,"Liked · Amazing location with lots of wildlife all around (fruit bats, monitor lizards, many different types of fish, sea turtles, sting rays, giant clams etc). Snorkelling experience is out of this world. Very peaceful atmosphere at the sunset villas. Complimentary foot massage and treats on arrival were perfect and made us feel very welcome. Airport pickup and drop off service was fantastic.

Disliked · The food quality varied, and meat dishes tended to be pricey. The hotel's snorkel gear was subpar, with damaged and mismatched pieces. Had we relied on this we would not have had such a great experience. I suggest bringing your own equipment. Day trips were on the expensive side, especially compared to options on the main island, which deterred us from participating. We were pleased with our stay in one of the sunset villas, but were disappointed that the quality and atmosphere of other accommodations on the island did not match our experience. The staff housing appeared to be in poor condition, bordering on squalor, which made us feel uncomfortable. It's odd that access to Eagle's Point(highest place on the island) is limited to sunrise and sunset, and only by appointment, accompanied by the island's security personnel."
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),John, Canada,Liked · Highly recommend this place if you want to relax and unwind in your vacation. The food is amazing too.
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Mark, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · Fantastic location with stunning scenario and corals.

Disliked · Wifi in the villa was not reliable, trying to book the spa for massage was challenging so we ended up not getting them"
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Gemma, United Kingdom,"Liked · staff are very helpful

Disliked · peace and private"
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Pearse, Ireland,"Liked · This is an incredible little piece of paradise. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we would definitely recommend to family and friends and we will happily return and look forward to it. The snorkelling was so much fun and there was so much to see. The food was very tasty and the service was very friendly. We loved being able to relax and have lunch on the beech and Gerrick (definitely spelt incorrectly) was exceptional who worked at the Dugong bar. We also had room service one of the nights and that was also a great option and a nice touch. Overall we cant fault our stay.

Disliked · My only issue was with the time it took to return the deposit held on my card at the start of our stay. I was emailing them 3 weeks after to see when this money would be returned to my card. I think this needs to be improved as we have never stayed anywhere else where this wasnt done immediately."
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Caroline, Singapore,"Liked · I went to Club Paradise for a quick getaway for my birthday and it doesnt disappoint me, the place is indeed a paradise. I booked the sunset villa and it has 2 double beds and 1 super single bed and the room was nice and clean. I like the tranquility of the island, the cyan color of the water and white sand. All the staffs are nice and accomodating and the service is worth a 5 star, cant wait to be back."

Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Cherry, Ireland,Liked · Privacy
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Justina, Germany,"Liked · The place is really a little paradise. They pick you up by van and boat. And in our case they were very flexible with picking up time and place, since we were already on the island day before. Beach is clean and beautiful. Snorkeling is possible just few meters further. I do not know how they manage to have all these services and food brought to this island

Disliked · Actually all way very nice. They have on island a fruit bats. The biggest of the type. Which I loved. Maybe others may not like it. But they hang all day on tree and do not bother humans"
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Yan, China,"Liked · Cozy room, and great sea and underwater view!

Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Aida, United States of America,"Liked · Staff were very nice and greeted you as they passed by. 2 bottles of fresh, filtered water was provided in your room daily. Food was delicious at Firefish restaurant. Children really enjoyed the pool. Great snorkeling on the house reef, just a few steps away from the beach. Van and boat transport from the airport to the hotel was inclusive and very convenient for us; it was great that we didnt have to worry about that. Our sunset villa was clean, updated, and comfortable.

Disliked · Only 1 restaurant available- but there was a wide selection of dishes."
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Blandina, United States of America,Liked · the excellent hospitality of the whole staff
Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),James, United Kingdom,"Liked · we stayed with Club Paradise for 3 nights as part of a two week trip around the Philippines. The island is beautiful, crystal clear water, lots of space and amazing animals.
We had some issues prior to arrival, essentially you have to arrive at Coron airport by 4pm in order to make the transfer window to the island. we had to take two additional flights in order to make the time and arrived pretty annoyed. Fritz and the rest of the team went out of their way to look after us and really rectified the situation.
The staff were outstanding with lots of lovely touches (morning coffee delivered to your villa, complementary guided hike to a viewing point and a lovely turn down gift)."
Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,József, Hungary,"Liked · That was our honeymoon 2nd resort to stay and they were extremely kind to us. Thats once in a lifetime place to visit.

Disliked · The pizza dough can be better (more Italian like)."
Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Perez, United States of America,"Liked · Overall, we were pleased with the services that were provided. The staff were helpful & cordial. The property was well maintained & clean.

Disliked · We had an unsatisfied experience when we dined in for dinner. We ordered crispy pata which was overcooked, very tough to eat & chew."
Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Jules, United States of America,Liked · This resort set the standard so high for their service staff that it is unmatched! Other hotels should train their staff on what it means to have excellent service! Cliff the water sports tour guide and life guard deserves all the recognition he can. He took excellent care of us and the rest of the staff made this trip an amazing and unforgettable experience
Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Mary, Philippines,"Liked · The staff were always warm, friendly, accommodating and kind and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. The location was absolutely stunning and the grounds beautifully kept. Mark Dalita, our guide on the two days we toured the islands, is exceptional at what he does and genuinely thrilled at sharing his hometown with guests.

Disliked · It was a beautiful stay from start to finish. There was one blip on our final day but it didn't ruin the experience and was not the fault of the resort per se. Two Seasons allows the use of drones beachside, just not near the cottages on the island's tip, so as to respect privacy. The problem was a drone user with an extra large drone-- it was bothersome to those of us relaxing on the shore and going in the water. The drone's buzzing was loud and the beeping noises from the remote control were annoying. Also, I don't think any of my party (and most likely other guests) had any desire to be captured on video. I will include a suggestion to the resort to ban drones-- they are invasive."
Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Laura, Colombia,"Liked · A paradise of its own, yet very near to Coron city. Beaches of powdered sand just for the the delight or its guests. No crowds of tourists. Its waters are crystal clear due to its proximity to Linapacan, known as one of the planets most clearest waters on the planet"
Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Gavin, Hong Kong,"Liked · Stunning setting, clear waters, palm trees, sunrises and sunsets visible from the beaches, warm greetings from staff, enjoyable experiences such as dining on the beach at sunset and water sports, private tours on offer, well kept grounds and staff on hand to tend to your needs. Dont miss out on a drink in the jacuzzi bar at the pool area, be sure to book a private beach setup for dinner at sunset. for private tours, dont miss out on Coron Island ultimate tour and the island hopping tour to Malcapuya Island and 2 others if you wish. the lunch provide at prearranged locations exceeded expectations. You can also take a walk across the sandbar at low tide to Bulog Dos Island and get your guide to tell you more and take photos for you, some of the staff are very talented with using iPhones so be sure to seek them out to get your postcard perfect shots. Also, the waters are full of marine life from baby sharks to stingrays and each time you pop in the clear waters is quite an experience to be surrounded by tropical fish. Overall, with blue sunny skies, youll feel in paradise and if youre looking to stay anywhere in Palawan when in Coron, this is the place for you.

Disliked · Only things would be advice or suggestions for improvements such as ensuring adequate food supplies as items didnt go out of stock and so affected food and drink choice from the menu. The spa was closed for renovation during our stay, but you could do a massage in your room. I would like to have seen a setup outside overlooking the waters for this in fact. make sure you apply insect repellent liberally as I came under attack with around 30 sand mite bites by the end of the trip. When the wind is up, the waters do get rough making boat trips back to Coron for the airport and to Coron Island for your tour rather rough, but the crew of your vessels know what theyre doing so youre in good hands."

Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Kimberly, United Kingdom,"Liked · The level of customer service was next level. Our room was beautiful - we stayed in the Sandbar Bungalow, but due to the typhoon, we were not able to use the plunge pool or really sit out, but thankfully the room was beautiful enough for us to just enjoy inside. Unfortunately, typhoon Paeng affected our trip and canceled our flights out of Coron. However, we got engaged (yay!) and despite things not going to plan, the hotel staff did everything they could to ensure that we felt safe and helped us enjoy our stay no matter the weather. They helped us celebrate our engagement as best we could and made it feel so special. They really went above and beyond to help us book our next flights out and ensure we had a place to stay another night. They immediately told us as soon as we were able to leave the mini island and take the boat to the main island, and even secured a room for us (at a very reasonable price) at their sister hotel - The Two Seasons Bayside Resort. The room we had was amazing - it was their Panorama Suite - and the service there was just as exceptional. We couldn't have been more appreciative of all the staff, especially Dana at the Two Seasons Island Resort. Thank you to all the staff and Resort Manager. We hope to visit again in the future!

Disliked · The Typhoon! But that obviously cannot be helped but the hotel made us feel very safe and assisted us with everything."

Spacious room, high ceiling, comfy bed, fridge with free drinks.
Very friendly and smiley staff. Helped quickly and smoothly with all the concerns.
Nice restaurant with live music and great waiters. Pork bbq skewers are really amazing.

Disliked · Street dogs literally everywhere. Running laps in the garden, greeting you under your chair and tables in resto, rolling under your sunbeds on the beach etc. Its not hygienic and very sad that staff just ignores them instead of trying to get this under control.
Roads in the area are totally broken and after heavy rain are not safe for driving. Would be good if hotel management try to fix the road at least in front of the hotel before someone gets injurured upon arrival.
There is nothing else in the area, so after few days felt bored even though hotel and beach are really nice."

We ended up staying longer due to a storm and they couldn't have been more helpful.

Breakfast buffet was fantastic with many choices and unlimited coffee. Also the hotels restaurant has great options both for lunch and dinner (last order for dinner is 9 pm). They serve happy hour as well from 4 pm to 6 pm. The staff was really kind and generous they upgraded our room for free. Great massages from the hotel. We highly recommend staying at this resort.
Nacpan Beach Resort,Jennifer, United Kingdom,"Liked · The location is stunning, Napcan beach is a beautiful beach unspoilt by mass tourism and with the most amazing sunsets. The hotel staff were very lovely and helpful and housekeeping did a great job. It was nice to be able to use the pool at the glamping as an option. The room was one of the largest we stayed in our whole trip and the aircon was very efficient (the room could benefit from some furniture to unpack into though, like a chest of drawers). We had a mountain view room which had lovely views out to the back and was quiet and peaceful.

Disliked · For me, the hotel is really let down by the breakfast and restaurant. I would have otherwise given it 10/10 but this knocked it down.
The restaurant is tired and run down and in need of some love. It had quite a sad vibe to it and although service was fine, it wasn't great. The breakfast was a buffet which I don't think really works well outdoors in that heat. There were melted plates of food with flies and ants on them every time we went and it was hard to find something hygienic to eat. I am not sure why they do not offer a smaller a la carte breakfast menu to avoid this issue. They did not offer any coffee or tea to order, just had a flask of instant coffee out.
The menus are very dirty and sticky, please clean or replace them!
The dogs at the restaurant need to be controlled. I understand the hotel say they are trying to address this issue, but I saw little evidence of this, just the odd spray of water here and there from some staff. There is a regular pack of dogs there and when people feed them from the table the staff turn a blind eye. I was afraid to eat there after a dog started growling at me under the table and acting unpredictably and we regularly were surrounded my dogs scratching fleas and sandflies over us.
It was such a shame, as if not for the restaurant this would have been a perfect stay, as the actual hotel is lovely. I would not chose to go back until these issues have been sorted."

3) The beach front which you can walk to right outside of the resort is one of the best beaches I have been to in my life. Its private so not alot of people.
4) Service was exceptional from check in to check out.. kudos to the entire team!"

Astoria Palawan,Olga, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · This one 5 starts hotel near Puerto Princesa. But I am not sure that we can call it 5 start hotel in our regular understanding.
But let me start with the advantages :
* big layout with a lot of activities : fire show in the evening, there is a small water park, good restaurant, there are much space to walk.
* friendly staff
* nice reception zone and beautiful territory

Disliked · The beach was closed while we were staying in the hotel. Guard said that this is because jelly fish season, but I believe that they had managed to do something if they would have wanted.
But at the same time you can swim in other beaches on the island. It is quite strange.
We faced with unpleasant situation with the water part. It's possible to visit it only once per stay, and it opens at 9.00.
We came at 9.20 and the entrance was closed. They said that the cashier has not come. It was odd, because we live in this hotel and they had allowed us if they would have wanted and then to sort out everything. At the end we came to the water park only after 30 minutes of waiting. I dont think that its a good service.

Astoria Palawan,Alexandre, Singapore,"Liked · Rooms are big with all the ammenities needed. Bed is also very comfty and everything clean and new. Terrasse in front of the room is nice for snack, apero or just to relax.
Breakfast in the morning has plenty of options and food is very nice. Also the free option for one entry at the water park is nice. There are kayaks, SUP or bikes at disposal for free and three different pools.

Disliked · Check-in process is very long and complicated. They recently opened a new building and moved the check-in there, with the old checkin only for check-outs. As in many hotels in the Philippines staff is super friendly but rather incompetent and super process-oriented.
Restaurant takes forever, so order at least 45min in advance to be sure to get it on time.
Despite zero waves and only knee-deep water the ""lifeguards"" don't leave you in the water. Everyone uses a different excuse ""jellyfish"", ""sharp rocks"" or dangerous shells. It seems that they just don't want anyone in the sea not to bother watching people there. Also the pool was not cleaned. There was a slimy cover on all stones and areas in the pool. I guess the pump was not working."

LIHIM RESORTS,Jessica, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · The resort is stunning and completely tucked away, yet only minutes from El Nido by speedboat. We had gorgeous views of the bay from our room, and ate the majority of our meals on the balcony because it was such a great setup. (Definitely eat as many Breakfasts in the room as possible!).
We had a villa with a pool, and I'd definitely recommend that type of room. The rooftop pool at Henri's was great as well, and the perfect place to watch sunset (make sure to go up for cocktails too). We ate dinner on the terrace to enjoy the fresh air, but the inside restaurant looked great as well.
The facilities were great - gorgeous pool that gets full sun at the entrance and main restaurant, and a decent gym and great spa - make sure to get a massage!
It's the people that really made it though, Claudia and Faith went above and beyond to make our stay memorable, from organizing our breakfasts, to customizing a private island hopping day, they did it all. We went out twice with Rio and Mark on the speedboat and had the best time - island hopping is a must, it's so stunning. Make sure to have lunch at their private lagoon (Cadlao lagoon) as well."

I also enjoyed every food I had from their restaurant. Kudos to the kitchen staff and chef!
I was hesitant to book here at first because there were only a few reviews, but I found out later on that the resort was fairly new.

Every other person on a public or private tour was jealous of our guide for good reason.

Food: Henri's has the BEST VIEW from daytime till the evening. Sunset is the best from the top of the island and the food is really well organized and served with good quality.
Drinks: they do have lots of great options from cocktails, whiskey, wines. I loved the Mosco mule from the pool the most.

Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,David, United Kingdom,"Liked · Room and beach view

Disliked · Staff's misleading information regarding the commute with main cities of the island . They tried to convince us that the is no local commute so we pay extra for their privet transfers."
Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Damhnaic, United Kingdom,Liked · A perfect location with all the facilities one could ask for. The villas were stunning and the restaurant food excellent along with the great staff.
Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Mario, United States of America,"Liked · Great destination, staff superb, clean facilities, location next to underground river and zip line, just a wonderful experience. The resort has a small number of cottages which make it perfect, not overcrowded. The landscape all around is artistically designed and well manicured. Security 24/7. Have I mentioned the staff was superb? No hidden fees, my bill was correct down to the peso.

Disliked · A minor dislike, but not a reason for not coming back, was that the sea is ten steps away and no fish (seafood)on the menu. The restaurant should have been heavy on grilled fish(es), shrimp, calamari, squid, etc."
Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Grachelle, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · 1. Arriving a bit late from 2 consecutive flights and 2 hour land travel, our patience is running low. Staff for some reason put us on an upper floor when all the while I believe we were booked on the ground floor because of my 2 active children. Had to insist on my preferred location and Abby and Jake patiently accommodated our request, even showing us possible options. its been a beautiful customer experience especially for a travelling family.
Thank you Jake from housekeeping and Abby from reception, you've been amazing.
2. the unit facing the beach itself is paradise. waking up in the morning just few steps away from the beach with a well manicured garden...fabulous! (its petty, but the tap in front of each unit is superb, for a person with OCD, this little detail to keep the room tidy is spot on!.)
3. the unit itself (we stayed in 801 - beach villa B. the difference between A, B and C if i am not mistaken is having a powder room or just a simple bathroom..i think....but we were in B and thats been lovely) the room was spacious enough.
4. Location is perfect - we simply walk along the beach to the little center where few restaurants and little shops are.
5. its close to the subterranean river and zipline site... No need to get package or tour - simply go to the tourism office and pay for the trip yourself, boats are there too. for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) we only spent less than 3000 pesos for the trip to the underground river and 550 for each for the zipline.
6. breakfast is well presented with attentive but not intrusive staff - Edmond and team, thank you for the beautiful experience. (my kids loved their eggs benedict!)
7. food is also good with reasonable price as well. They have an amazing chef presenting Filipino dishes quite well (they have other options too).
8. i love it that its independent and not a hotel chain so you are kind of supporting smaller businesses but it is with a 5 star quality.

Disliked · its not hotels fault but just the presence of this insect called Nik-nik, like little blood suckers, am still healing from the bites after 3 weeks. they dont get turned off by mosquito repellants but we were told ""Off lotion"" is more useful.
so appreciate Ivan for giving us his cream... thats customer service on an extra mile..."
Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Ken, United States of America,"Liked · Just a really nice place. We went there in the off-season so there was hardly anyone there. We had the whole place to ourselves and it was great

Disliked · The restaurant was great, and the food was excellent, however, the wine list was nonexistent. Apparently, somebody in charge believes that the only way to sell wine is by the entire bottle. This is a mistake, and one that I asked that they correct, but they seemed to care less. We were offered a choice of red, white, and rosé. Each of these wines came from a nondescript winery in Spain. I was able to get a sample of the red wine and it was terrible. I recommend the staff spend just a small amount of time and acquire some wines from other places and the world, and that they pay attention to the fact that wine IS food, and it should be offered and paired with food appropriately. Ignoring this fact is unwise, but that is exactly what this resort has done and continues to do. Please fix this at once, then let me know and perhaps I'll return for another visit."

The restaurant was first class with amazing food and incredible service. The Wi-Fi worked excellent in the rooms, the beach was large and clean with beautiful warm water. It was a little on the expensive side, but we enjoyed our stay.

Disliked · This property is very very far from any activities except the underground river. If you want to sit on a beautiful white sand beach and enjoy relaxation this is a place for you. If you want other restaurants, bars or activities, then I would not recommend this location. ?"

The staff was incredibly warm and accommodating, making me feel right at home. The rooms were comfortable and beautifully designed, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding nature. The on-site restaurant served mouthwatering dishes especially the calamares and shrimp. It's a must try. And the range of activities (like you can swim, you can go to the gym, spa for additional relaxation, and roofdeck for the view) available ensured there was never a dull moment.

The hotel is beautiful, free massages, lovely pool and stunning view. Plus free transfer to the airport and mall. Our favourite place we stayed in the Philippines. Thank you so much."
Panja Resort Palawan,Reigine, Philippines,"Liked · It was quiet and very relaxing. The spa was excellent and I kept going there for massages. They also provide complimentary transfers to the mall. The staff was accommodating too.

Disliked · My only feedback is that there was only one bath towel (per person) in the room - it would be great if there was a hand towel, and towels were available for the pool. Other suggestions, which really didn't effect my stay nor make the resort any less fabulous would be to include a bathrobe and some milk/creamer in the room for tea/coffee."

I was looking for this resort for a week, hesitant cause still pricey but well it was worth it with the service and the place was really relaxing. We are both easily get bitten by mosquito, its just us so tht was our concern but they had the repellant everywhere, from the room and outside the property so it was good.

I cannot express how truly incredible my husband and my stay was.
First off, the resort: just paradise! The cottages are beautiful, comfortable, have great AC, pool overlooking the beautiful beach, everything is so stunning and perfect. Quick ride less than 10 mins to El Nido town.
The restaurant: we ate here almost every meal and loved everything we had!
The staff: ABOVE AND BEYOND! Staff treated us like family, helped us take care of literally everything we could need. Without going into too much detail, my husband and I are from the United States and were in a motorbike accident which he got cut very badly in the leg. On our tricycle ride to the emergency clinic, we had them stop at Buko so I could run and grab money. Stephanie at the front desk ran back up to the tricycle with me and came to help us get to the clinic and made sure the driver waited there to take us back once my husband was treated. She insisted on staying to make sure everything went okay. Once back at the resort, Stephanie, Esmeralda, and the rest of the staff wwent absolutely leaps and bounds beyond any care and hospitality we would have expected. I am honestly brought to tears thinking of how cared for we felt during such a scary experience.
Oh and we were here for my birthday as well and everyone made me feel so special when they found out!
I am so excited to come back to Buko (with some friends as well next time!) and I cannot reccomend this amazing resort enough. We have traveled quite a bit and can honestly say we have NEVER been treated as well as we were at Buko Beach Resort."
Buko Beach Resort,Michal, Greece,"Liked · The location is amaizing! the best sunset view from the pool. The rooms are really nice and i loved the bathroom and the shower, very pastoral. The stuff were really nice and they helped us with everything even if we didn't asked. like going outside on the rain just to buy us sigrets and they even found us plain ticked when all the fights were sold out!!!"
Buko Beach Resort,Rita, Portugal,"Liked · I would say that the place itself is incredibly beautiful. The outside bathroom in the room (private) is something stunning.
I loved having breakfast at their restaurant as the morning light and peaceful of the place is amazing.
The staff is super nice, very friendly and always looking forward to help you.
We rented a moto to travel around the island so the fact the hotel is not in the busy city center was a plus for us.

Disliked · There isnt anything that we didnt love about the place. For us is quiet hard to sleep with day light entering the room as the windows dont really have black outs, but I guess thats the price you pay to be in the nature."
Buko Beach Resort,Juan, Spain,"Liked · Location, staff and restaurant are great!"
Buko Beach Resort,Tho, United States of America,"Liked · We booked the grand villa with the private pool with the beachfront. I highly recommend it. The Buko resort felt luxurious without losing the cultural authenticity of a Filipino beach town. From the bamboo rooms and furniture to the menu items. I really enjoyed have the best of both worlds during my stay here. My family loved starting our day at the restaurant with the spectacular view and great service. We also loved that the Buko team went above and beyond to celebrate my mom's birthday in addition to assisting us with our tours and adventures. P.S. go for the massages, they were amazing.

Disliked · My two minor suggestions for improvement would be to have a lock to the front door of the Grand Villa for safety reasons in general. The lighting in the living room was a bit too dim for night time so maybe adding a few more lamps would keep the lively atmosphere going. Other than that, it was an exceptional stay!"

The food at the restaurant was good! Would definitely recommend getting some traditional Filipino food if you can.
The hotel is also in a great area with some really nice bars and restaurants around!

Disliked · We did have a few issues with the water in our shower and sink (at times the water wasnt coming out at all, and at times it was coming out but was spitting up muck). Maintenance did the best they could to resolve the problem, but I think it was more to do with the storms that had come through than anything they could do.
We didnt swim in the ocean while we were there (the storm had made it pretty uninviting), but we were also told its not entirely possible because of how shallow it is. The pool is perfectly fine if you want to take a dip. Just dont expect to be able to swim in the ocean during your stay. It does make for excellent stand up paddle boarding conditions though, apparently!"

Disliked · I never understood why are there no sunbeds. The hotel has a small pool, but it is really small one and no sunbeds, so spending there the whole day would be a little challanging since you have no place to go  the beach is nearby, but nobody is actually (also other people, not just hotel guests) is staying on it."

Matinloc Resort,, Philippines,"Liked · Under recent health protocol restrictions, heading to El Nido meant navigating fluctuating multiple tourism and local requirements. But it was all so worth it from the time we landed until the end of our stay. Our deep thanks to Jayson Guilalas for making magic happen with his team while wearing multiple hats . He picked us up from the airport, handled the boat ride process to Matinloc Island and upon arriving there, surprised us with fab news that we had been upgraded to a beach villa. We were Matinlocs first guests after 11 months of Covid-19 shutdown so the resort was keen to show its best service ...which they did generously and flexibly. Because we were only 2 guests for 5 days, we pre-selected our meals from an extensive menu beforehand to make sense for procurement under the special circumstances. We werent disappointed  we enjoyed our vegetarian and pescatarian selections. The resort had its own fresh fish stocked by the jetty. Big thanks to Jonathan (F&B) who took such good care of us, consistently pro-active with ideas ie. dine in areas to watch the moon rise and on our last night, taking almost 2 hours to fix and decorate a special gazebo for our dinner! The spa wasnt operational due to Covid-19 but we didnt even look for it. The beach villa had generous proportions, and the other rooms we saw also reflected both thoughtful design and good size. In general, I was surprised at how well-constructed the buildings are, and really pleased at the availability of WiFi throughout. (It helps to have a Globe telco tower in the island too.) Great beach front for easy snorkeling and a white sand lagoon accessible via 5 min kayak. So for city executives looking to recharge and/or to Work-from-Wherever (versus WFH), check out Matinloc .... and do those emails and Zoom calls in spacious rooms with a gorgeous views, or with sand between your toes."

The location is in between airport and city proper so just right. Whenever it gets rainy at night, you need not go elsewhere for dinner as their restaurant serves good food and also there is entertainment (a band or fire dance).
If you need to go to town proper, just request the reception for a tricycle and they will gladly call for you.
Their partner tour company, Bathala, took care of our two tours for 2 days and we super enjoyed it, even with a toddler (they were super caring and lovely with my daughter).

Disliked · They can get busy especially when there is a bit of crowd checking in or checking out so if you have a bit of things with you (ie multiple luggages), especially during check out, request in advance assistance to carry stuff to lobby. But if a staff sees you carrying luggage, guaranteed they will assist you."
Tag Resort,Vishal, United Kingdom,"Liked · Really nice room and facilities.

It was great to have a really nice bathroom and hot shower which we didn't always get in other locations in Phili.

We arrived at 9:00am and they allowed us an early check in. Someone also assisted us with the check in the moment we arrived at the lobby.

So we came to Coron four days earlier than we planned. This was literally booked one day in advance. And we lucked out. What we loved especially was the hospitality! The staff was EXCEPTIONAL. Jen at the front desk was super lovely and helpful to us. This place is geared toward adults, but even our kids (15, 8) loved it here. They agree that the staff was wonderful! Everyday they gave complimentary snacks in the afternoon. And complimentary juices and fruit. Large refillable water bottles as well. Our kids got the Cub room that can sleep three, overlooking the more shallow pool (with jacuzzi) My husband and I got the Mara room which is next to their deeper pool in a more quiet spot of the hotel. It was the best room, so relaxing. Good wifi!! Very clean. Rooftop bar with two jacuzzis! Saturdays they have a buffet dinner with a lovely band. We cannot say enough great things about this place."

There were so many small touches that all added up to make such a difference - the offer to take our bags, the complimentary water and snacks by the pool, complimentary drinks on rainy days, engagement from staff, recommendations on activities or places, and so much more! The food in the restaurant was delicious and good value for money. The Massages were excellent. I could go on.

Disliked · We had 2 vegetarians in our group, who struggled to find very much that was suitable to them which was unfortunate"
The Funny Lion - Coron,Lutchie, United Kingdom,"Liked · Staff

Disliked · Food at the restaurant is expensive. Recommend eating outside."
The Funny Lion - Coron,Juliet, United Kingdom,"Liked · The Funny Lion was a warm and welcoming oasis just outside the hustle and bustle of Coron town. The staff were incredibly helpful and went above and beyond assisting us with your bookings and transfers. We felt very valued here. We also loved the live music evening and made frequent trips to the spa for massages which were the best weve ever had.

Disliked · We really enjoyed the food at The Funny Lion but we didnt like the taste of the oil used for deep drying - it gave the fries a coconut flavour."
The Funny Lion - Coron,Peter, United States of America,"Liked · Wonderful property with the highlight being the staff - shout outs to Ian and Chris Kim and Jay! My wife and I stayed here for a week and couldnt get the entire week off work so we had a bit of a workcation and the first room we were in didnt have the best internet (the speeds were fine but not very stable) and they were kind enough to upgrade us to a villa and we had great internet/wifi connection the rest of our stay! So if you need to work during your stay, you should opt to pay for villa
The breakfast was included each morning and was a great buffet style that alternated each day and everything was pretty delicious. I enjoyed the coffee a lot which I think was a local brew. The roof top bar had great pizza and a beautiful view with two jacuzzis to relax in - the drinks were also fantastic and all the cocktails were tasty, and the bartender knew what I meant when I asked for less sweet, they delivered (no pun!) Speak of, room service from the restaurant was very good and I enjoyed the burger a lot.
Would definitely stay here again if/when were back in Coron!

Disliked · Not many complaints - the wifi was challenging at first but the staff was so accommodating and wonderful to upgrade us to a villa to have a better connection. We did have to ask a few time for certain housekeeping requests - like our sheets changed rather than made over but very minor inconveniences in an overall wonderful stay."

Disliked · Air conditioning unit could of been in a better position, in the room as was very warm during the night to try sleep."
Munting Paraiso,Maksim, Estonia,"Liked · Nice cottage with terrace and hammock
Friendly staff. Greeted with welcome drink, organized airport tranfer (300 pesos one way)- nice big van, perfectly on time.
Good and reasonably priced food in on site restaurant.

Disliked · Wifi connection is slow, signal unstable-on and off.
Soundproof is not good- could hear all neighbours talks on their terraces.
Pool has great hanging chairs over the water but water itself is not clean at all- it was not circulating and looked like a soup. Decided to skip swimming.
Lots of mosquitos outside, so could not spend much fime on the terrace, which looks comfy and really nice."
Munting Paraiso,Ingrid, Belgium,"Liked · The people , it was very quite and only 300m from the Prestine beach. There were only some local people swimming and some fisherman getting ready to go fishing so not touristy at all. I loved it. The foid in the restaurant was excellent food.

Disliked · It was a bit far ( 3 KM) from the center so in the evening there was nothing to do.
The WiFi in the room was very unstable. You needed to stay outside in order not to be interrupted."
Munting Paraiso,Amr, Qatar,Liked · Stayed for one night to travel back to Cebu and all was good and friendly staff
Munting Paraiso,Justine, United Kingdom,"Liked · The hotel really exceeded our expectations. They offered airport pickup and drop off 300 pesos each way which was a really good price and also convenient as it was our first time in Puerto Princesa/Palawan. The driver was easy to find in the airport arrivals area and he was very helpful and nice. When we got to the hotel, the reception staff were really friendly and told us all the information we needed, including letting us know about tourist activities like city tour packages, massages, island hopping etc. They also had a golf cart to help take us and our luggages to our rooms which was really helpful because the property was bigger than expected. The rooms were also very spacious and the shower room too. One of the best parts was definitely the nature and vibe of the hotel. The rooms were basically like mini cottages with your own outside seating area including a hammock which was my favourite part, we loved to use it every day and night to relax, drink, have a nice sit after dinner etc. The outdoor area was surrounded by the beautifully landscaped gardens; there were beautiful plants like bamboos, a massive overhanging tree, snake plants etc and it looked even more beautiful when it rained which it did a couple times during our stay. Another great part of the hotel was the restaurant. There was a lot of food on the menu, including delicious classic Filipino dishes but also pasta, sandwiches etc. They had amazing mango and calamansi smoothies, beer, and nicely made cocktails. The restaurant staff were nice&friendly also. We also booked a city tour package for 700pesos each which was a good price because we went to many sites around PP, including our favourite the Crocodile farm getting to see the massive crocs and holding a baby one too, the tour guide was also friendly and funny :) We also booked a massage and the masseuse came to our room which was convenient. Everything, from scenery to service, was excellent. Overall, an unforgettable experience.

Disliked · Not much to dislike, maybe just that the wifi voucher you're given is only allowed for one device so couldn't use it for my laptop but wasn't a big deal since I just used my personal hotspot on my phone whenever I needed it."

Munting Paraiso,Bram, Philippines,"Liked · I recently had a pleasant stay at this establishment. The room provided ample space, and the bed was comfortable, allowing for a good night's sleep. I appreciated the presence of a kitchen area and a proper refrigerator, which added convenience to my stay. Also, everything was in good shape (unfortunately, that is not so obvious here in the Philippines). The location is good, close to the airport and there are many day trips that will pick you up. Overall, it was a positive experience, and I would recommend it.

Its within easy walking distance of the centre and restaurants, and convenient for island hopping or diving trips. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The reception staff are just wonderful, and make the visit very pleasant. I rebooked there on my return to Coron from el nido a few days later.

Disliked · Its a bit of an art (which I didnt fully master) getting the shower temperature right."

Corto del Mar Hotel,Cathy, Philippines,"Liked · What made us return to this romantic hotel is not just the wonderfully clever and detailed design of the hotel itself, its also the friendly team and the cleanliness. The team always seems to aim (and achieve) to go above and beyond by taking their time to learn about your plans and finding ways to assist. We casually told of our plans to take a ferry to El Nido upon check-out and the next morning we were informed that transport to the ferry would be ready. We did not even tell them at what time we would leave but they planned it spot-on. The ladies truly know how to anticipate the needs of their guests. The service at the bar/restaurant is good, especially combined with the meals and drinks they deliver.
Our favorite hotel on one of the most beautiful islands we have seen on our travels."

Disliked · During our stay, there wasn't a hot water for shower and bath. They told us there was a water main break on the facility."
Coron Westown Resort,Fenchie, Philippines,"Liked · It is located away from the busy town which is a great plus. There were 3 pools and are very kid friendly. Also the rooms were spacious although we would have loved to get the family as what we initially planned but turned out unavailable when we got there. The staff were great to just give us two deluxe rooms without additional charges.

Disliked · Theres a stinking smell around the pool area, i think its from the toilets exhaust, the one below the pool. Also the room floor is kind of slippery, i wish there was complimentary slippers for the room."
Coron Westown Resort,Margaret, Philippines,Liked · the rooms are beautiful and the food is good.
Coron Westown Resort,Jmbrosa, Portugal,"Liked · The architecture of the hotel is very beautiful, we stayed in a room with a Kings bed and the view was phenomenal (sea view) from the balcony. The resort has several pools if you want to take a dip after the tours or walks.
The bed is super comfortable, the whole room is very clean and very spacious.
Breakfast is a buffet, but it's always the same every day.
A good place if you are looking for a quiet place and take the family

Disliked · The only downside is that it is far from the center, but taking a tricycle from the door takes you to the center in a few minutes and is not expensive."
Coron Westown Resort,Maningo, Philippines,"Liked · The resort already have everything that you want especially if you dont like to stroll around the town. They have live band every night where you can chill on or a pool where you want relax at. They have also this welcoming cockatoo that greet and entertain us always while waiting for our service. Room make up is excellent same as with the front desk who always take care of our needs as well as the concierge and bell boys who are very accommodating to assist.

Disliked · Room tiles is slippery and it is not good for infants or toddlers who like to run around. Sometimes it moisten maybe because of the aircon temperature so we need to lower it to avoid our kids to get slipped. Another is the waiters/waitress at the restaurant during breakfast were not alert enough to welcome and assist the guest. You need to request them to place the utensils on the table first before they prepare it for you."

Coron Westown Resort,Matsglobetrotter, Italy," Liked · Loved the pool.and the room once we got the room we booked as per booking .com. very friendly staff. Excellent mango shakes:-) lovely music in the evenings

Disliked · That they put us in a side room that does not even show on any pictures with so limited view its.. not as per advetized. That they claim it was the room we booked while its very clear on booking that this was not the case. It was a lower price overflow room for those who dont specify anything.. that it took them one night to fix the problem.no point blaming the systems as the systems need to be configured by someone, to ensure right category room show up on both booking.com and other similar sites.
Breakfast place need a better solution for the gazzillion flies we were met with."

Disliked · Gym was not airconditioned and was facing west so it was like hell using the treadmill in the afternoon. There were only 4 equipment there and 2 were under maintenance.
Ordered room service: sinigang na isda... the soup tasted good but the fish was so tasteless. Calamares also did not tasted terrible.
There was a live band on Friday or Saturday night and I initially thought it was a hotel guest with an unpleasant voice hogging the karaoke for hours."

Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Elizabeth, Germany,"Liked · The friendly hotel staffs that made our stay bearable. They did their job well even and always smiling inspite of stressful times. They all deserve salary raise from the hotel management sitting comfortably in Manila. Location is nice and how we wish the management will do more to preserve the Mangrove forests there and not to put up expensive Water Villas on it. Please get rid of the garbage near the Water Villas. The pool is lovely. Kudos to the guy cleaning on the pool. Love the shower because of the great water pressure.

Disliked · Our room smells moldy and one can see molds in the bathroom. Very expensive for a soft-opening! Breakfast is not at all a 5 star hotel level. The hotel staffs cannot do anything about it. They can only prepare what the management will provide for them. Notbmuch space to put/hang clothes. For the late cleaning of rooms, I am not complaining. I only pity these guys who are the only ones cleaning the whole hotel rooms. They deserve all the tips they got from us everyday. No ironing board and other basics. 5 star hotel? Definitely not."
Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Marisa, South Africa,"Liked · The bed was very comfortable and the swimming pool was amazing.

Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Brian, United States of America,"Liked · Pool was great.

Disliked · Room was good, but bed was tough on my back. Room had a poor view of under renovation pond, lots of construction noise throughout the day. Food in restaurant was good, however, timing of food service was poor, for example two of us ordered dinner. Hers was served in :15 minutes, mine was served in :30 minutes. Cooks must be able to time their cooking so that all meals are completed and served at the same time. Cooks did not know how to cook eggs over easy. Most of the amenities did not seem available as it was under renovation. This was not disclosed during booking."
Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Soren, Denmark,"Liked · The room was very good and the direct access to the pool was excellent.

Disliked · The meaning of Soft opening should have been explained on the website. It turns out that most of the resort was undergoing major renovations with most of the facilities shut down and noise from the construction of a new major wing (5 stories high) all day.
I think that a major discount should have been given for the inconveniences, which by the way will last for all of 2023."

Disliked · slight construction noise from the new tower they are building, but it wasn't really a problem. The breakfast buffet is marginal in availability, variety.and slow service staff, but again, this is a soft opening, so be patient."

Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Maria, Canada,"Liked · Panoramic suite is amazing
Disliked · My flight with airswift was cancelled because of maintenance repair . If the plane prior to us had to make an emergency landing cuz the propeller busted and was not working , I think there was warrant for airswift to do maintentence repair with all the planes . In saying this we werent able to go to coron because all flights were grounded for 5 days. I had payed already for the panoramic suite the day our flight was cancelled hence we missed one night stay . Despite airswift giving us a certificate of cancellation and providing receipts we had payed for our night stay , the hotel refused to give a refund which was totally disappointing and disgusting cuz it was not our fault . You would thing they would be understanding and give refund  I was wrong. I totally enjoyed our only night stay the day we were able to get to stay which was the next day . Hotel is very nice but because of this experience I will not stay there again . Weve booked in hotels with no problems of refunds when flights were cancelled . It was a very frustrating event ."

Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Phoenicia, United States of America,"Liked · The staff is excellent friendly and thoughtful. Me and my husband take vacations quiet often and this is the only place that asked us the night before what time we will be checking out, so that they could prepare and pack our breakfast for us. We checked out around 5am, and we were able to leave with hot breakfast, which helped a lot.

Disliked · The only thing we didnt like was that we missed checking in the first night we were supposed to be there, due to a delayed flight. We booked three nights and only stayed for two nights. The manager asked us to provide proof of the delayed flight, which we ended up emailing to her before we checked out, but the manager never bothered replying or acknowledging our email."

Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Simone, Australia,"Liked · We loved staying at Two seasons. The room was pretty spacious and very clean. we had some amazing views of the bay. The pool was also amazing and we got some good use out of the gym (although the setup in there is reasonably basic). The dinner at the restaurant at the hotel was also delicious.

Disliked · The breakfast was fine but nothing special - we ordered poached eggs 2 days in a row and they took about 30 minutes to come.. coffee and some of the local food options were delicious though"
Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Juan, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · amazing location, beautiful sunset view, pool and friendly staff"
Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Daniel, United States of America,"Liked · It was nice for a change (for us at least) to stay at a hotel with a 5-star quality look and feel. The amenities were great, including the pool. The gym was sufficient for my purposes (just free weights, a treadmill, maybe another cardio machine). The a la carte food and drink was decent and not too overly priced for a hotel of this caliber.
The staff was also very professional and polite. They remembered my name throughout my short 2-night stay, and were always very helpful.

Disliked · I know this isn't entirely on them, but they are associated. The private tour I got through the hotel (which is great that you can charge to your room btw) was on time to pick me up from the hotel, but then we sat on the boat and waited for over 45min, close to an hour on the boat itself in the harbor just waiting for the tour guide. It's just not something that I would expect when you knowingly pay an upcharge by booking through the hotel. It was about 200 dollars for an ""8 hour island escapade tour"" that had me sitting on a boat in the harbor waiting for the guide for almost 1 of those 8 hours.
Location is also not too central, though it's only about a 20min walk into town. You'd think it would be more quiet but there was a bar nearby that you could hear at night.
Lastly, the included breakfast was subpar for what I would expect from this caliber of hotel. Certainly acceptable, but just did not have many traditional options. Though I tend to try to eat traditional food on my travels - they did have waffles, pancakes, and an omelet station so if you eat mostly western, you should be fine."

The pool was so beautiful and the temperature of the water was just perfect for a hot and sunny day. Location was great as well, close to everywhere by tuktuk and there was a massage place and a convenient store right in front of the hotel. The room was specious and overall clean.
Beds were comfortable and large. And a special thanks to Adam the bartender who made us feel so welcome with a great service and smile.

Disliked · They were ants everywhere in the room even though we did not leave any food laying around. The sink faucet slashed everywhere each time we opened it. And the water in the toilet sometimes would not go down the drain.
