1,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Frank, United States of America,"Liked  Amazing location. How can you not love a private island? Decent snorkeling right from the beaches, great villas on the beach, good food, welcome foot rub! The Coron tour was fantastic I would recommend it to anyone. The animals were really cool to see, even if they scared us a couple times lol.

Disliked  The spa was just ok. The massage itself was great but the inside was hot and they didn't have a pillow to put under your feet so my ankles were hurting pretty bad by the end of it."
2,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Marqes, Philippines,"Liked  The staff and service were amazing, awesome presentation, welcome drinks, afternoon snacks, toiletries....
Amazing view, sadly we didnt get to do any water activities this trip.

Disliked  Breakfast was great!! But for the price of the food, food could do some improvements, more selections too..."
3,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Gianna, Philippines,"Liked  the island itself was amazing no doubt but the highlight for me was the staff. they were very accommodating, friendly, & helpful. I also loved how much they cared for the animals around the island."
4,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Paul, United States of America,"Liked  Privacy, exceptional service, beautiful location"
5,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Debbie, Germany,"Liked  great location, service is top notch, quiet, and brings you pretty close to nature. the island is beautiful with perfect emerald waters despite the sun not fully showing up! the villa is lux and we get to enjoy a free foot spa!

Disliked  not like is a strong word, the food taste could be better. don't get me wrong it is still good"
6,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Wesley, United Kingdom,"Liked  Amazing location with lots of wildlife all around (fruit bats, monitor lizards, many different types of fish, sea turtles, sting rays, giant clams etc). Snorkelling experience is out of this world. Very peaceful atmosphere at the sunset villas. Complimentary foot massage and treats on arrival were perfect and made us feel very welcome. Airport pickup and drop off service was fantastic.

Disliked  The food quality varied, and meat dishes tended to be pricey. The hotel's snorkel gear was subpar, with damaged and mismatched pieces. Had we relied on this we would not have had such a great experience. I suggest bringing your own equipment. Day trips were on the expensive side, especially compared to options on the main island, which deterred us from participating. We were pleased with our stay in one of the sunset villas, but were disappointed that the quality and atmosphere of other accommodations on the island did not match our experience. The staff housing appeared to be in poor condition, bordering on squalor, which made us feel uncomfortable. It's odd that access to Eagle's Point(highest place on the island) is limited to sunrise and sunset, and only by appointment, accompanied by the island's security personnel."
7,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),John, Canada,Liked  Highly recommend this place if you want to relax and unwind in your vacation. The food is amazing too.
8,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Mark, United Arab Emirates,"Liked  Fantastic location with stunning scenario and corals.

Disliked  WiFi is very hot and miss when needed to catch up online for an hour each day! But not a deal breaker!"
9,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Ronald, Canada,"Liked  Staff was very friendly and helpful, the resort was very clean and breakfast was delicious

Disliked  Wifi in the villa was not reliable, trying to book the spa for massage was challenging so we ended up not getting them"
10,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Gemma, United Kingdom,"Liked  staff are very helpful

Disliked  peace and private"
11,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Pearse, Ireland,"Liked  This is an incredible little piece of paradise. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we would definitely recommend to family and friends and we will happily return and look forward to it. The snorkelling was so much fun and there was so much to see. The food was very tasty and the service was very friendly. We loved being able to relax and have lunch on the beech and Gerrick (definitely spelt incorrectly) was exceptional who worked at the Dugong bar. We also had room service one of the nights and that was also a great option and a nice touch. Overall we can뭪 fault our stay.

Disliked  My only issue was with the time it took to return the deposit held on my card at the start of our stay. I was emailing them 3 weeks after to see when this money would be returned to my card. I think this needs to be improved as we have never stayed anywhere else where this wasn뭪 done immediately."
12,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Caroline, Singapore,"Liked  I went to Club Paradise for a quick getaway for my birthday and it doesn뭪 disappoint me, the place is indeed a paradise. I booked the sunset villa and it has 2 double beds and 1 super single bed and the room was nice and clean. I like the tranquility of the island, the cyan color of the water and white sand. All the staffs are nice and accomodating and the service is worth a 5 star, can뭪 wait to be back."
13,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Rene, Austria,"Liked  Do it, book this hotel (source: we've been to 100+ beach accomodations and this is among the top)."
14,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Cherry, Ireland,Liked  Privacy
15,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Justina, Germany,"Liked  The place is really a little paradise. They pick you up by van and boat. And in our case they were very flexible with picking up time and place, since we were already on the island day before. Beach is clean and beautiful. Snorkeling is possible just few meters further. I do not know how they manage to have all these services and food brought to this island

Disliked  Actually all way very nice. They have on island a fruit bats. The biggest of the type. Which I loved. Maybe others may not like it. But they hang all day on tree and do not bother humans"
16,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Yan, China,"Liked  Cozy room, and great sea and underwater view!

Disliked  International food in restaurant is not authentic."
17,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Ethel, United States of America,"Liked  Club Paradise Palawan is a phenomenal destination. What sets this resort apart is the friendliness of all the staff. We love the sunset villa, amenities, food, and the staff. Everyone should visit this resort!"
18,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Aida, United States of America,"Liked  Staff were very nice and greeted you as they passed by. 2 bottles of fresh, filtered water was provided in your room daily. Food was delicious at Firefish restaurant. Children really enjoyed the pool. Great snorkeling on the house reef, just a few steps away from the beach. Van and boat transport from the airport to the hotel was inclusive and very convenient for us; it was great that we didn뭪 have to worry about that. Our sunset villa was clean, updated, and comfortable.

Disliked  Only 1 restaurant available- but there was a wide selection of dishes."
19,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),Blandina, United States of America,Liked  the excellent hospitality of the whole staff
20,Club Paradise Palawan (Coron),James, United Kingdom,"Liked  we stayed with Club Paradise for 3 nights as part of a two week trip around the Philippines. The island is beautiful, crystal clear water, lots of space and amazing animals.
We had some issues prior to arrival, essentially you have to arrive at Coron airport by 4pm in order to make the transfer window to the island. we had to take two additional flights in order to make the time and arrived pretty annoyed. Fritz and the rest of the team went out of their way to look after us and really rectified the situation.
The staff were outstanding with lots of lovely touches (morning coffee delivered to your villa, complementary guided hike to a viewing point and a lovely turn down gift)."
