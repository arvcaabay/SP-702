1,Buko Beach Resort,Shany, Israel,"Liked · It’s a very intimate place which is exactly what we looked for (there are only a few cabins). You have all the facilities you need for a perfect stay and a private beach where u can enjoy El Nido’s beautiful sunset.
I must mention the staff , they were sooo helpful with everything and extremely nice. If we come again,we definitely choose Buko again.

Disliked · We ate dinner at the resort’s restaurant the service and atmosphere were great but the food was average."
2,Buko Beach Resort,Jeckoy, United States of America,Liked · The staff were the best - very welcoming to my family and accommodated our needs. They even did something special for someone's birthday in my family. The Grand Villa was incredible and the location is right off the beach to watch the beautiful sunsets from Corong Corong. The breakfast and restaurant food was very delicious too! Highly recommend this place.

5,Buko Beach Resort,Nicola, United Kingdom,"Liked · I couldn't speak more highly of this place and its staff. The staff were simply incredible. Always friendly and went out of their way for us, probably daily, to ensure we had zero stress and felt incredibly special. Very promptly answered WhatsApp messaging service so we literally didn't have to lift a finger.... genius!
The in room massages were out of this world good. Food fantastic. Pool spotless. Huts well set out and very comfortable Sunset views stunning. Seamless transfers organised in complete luxury for our drive to Puerto Princesa
Not to mention the very special surprise we had waiting for us in our room to congratulate us on our honeymoon when we got there. Signed by all the staff
Thank you to everyone at Buko Beach Resort for getting our honeymoon off to such a memorable and special start.... we WILL be back ??"

7,Buko Beach Resort,Glai, Philippines,"Liked · they are very organize and hospitable, like they already forseen what you need, kudos to Rose-Ann, the friendly bartender at the bar, you made our day!, we stayed there for 2 nights, it was a relaxing time as we finished all our island activities, my Bf wants to stay in a nice room cause he checked the weather forecast and it will rain for the next days. I was looking for this resort for a week, hesitant cause still pricey but well it was worth it with the service and the place was really relaxing. We are both easily get bitten by mosquito, it’s just us so tht was our concern but they had the repellant everywhere, from the room and outside the property so it was good. The food was exceptionally great, my partner is a bit picky but in Buko beach he ate everything what’s on plate. I definitely recommend it if you want a relaxing moment."
8,Buko Beach Resort,Carlos, Colombia,"Liked · everything was great, the staff was fantastic !"
9,Buko Beach Resort,Mihai, Romania,Liked · Everything was amazing! It was the best experience!
10,Buko Beach Resort,Shauna, United States of America,"Liked · Absolutely exceptional!!!
I cannot express how truly incredible my husband and my stay was.
First off, the resort: just paradise! The cottages are beautiful, comfortable, have great AC, pool overlooking the beautiful beach, everything is so stunning and perfect. Quick ride less than 10 mins to El Nido town.
The restaurant: we ate here almost every meal and loved everything we had!
The staff: ABOVE AND BEYOND! Staff treated us like family, helped us take care of literally everything we could need. Without going into too much detail, my husband and I are from the United States and were in a motorbike accident which he got cut very badly in the leg. On our tricycle ride to the emergency clinic, we had them stop at Buko so I could run and grab money. Stephanie at the front desk ran back up to the tricycle with me and came to help us get to the clinic and made sure the driver waited there to take us back once my husband was treated. She insisted on staying to make sure everything went okay. Once back at the resort, Stephanie, Esmeralda, and the rest of the staff wwent absolutely leaps and bounds beyond any care and hospitality we would have expected. I am honestly brought to tears thinking of how cared for we felt during such a scary experience.
Oh and we were here for my birthday as well and everyone made me feel so special when they found out!
I am so excited to come back to Buko (with some friends as well next time!) and I cannot reccomend this amazing resort enough. We have traveled quite a bit and can honestly say we have NEVER been treated as well as we were at Buko Beach Resort."
11,Buko Beach Resort,Michal, Greece,"Liked · The location is amaizing! the best sunset view from the pool. The rooms are really nice and i loved the bathroom and the shower, very pastoral. The stuff were really nice and they helped us with everything even if we didn't asked. like going outside on the rain just to buy us sigrets and they even found us plain ticked when all the fights were sold out!!!"
12,Buko Beach Resort,Rita, Portugal,"Liked · I would say that the place itself is incredibly beautiful. The outside bathroom in the room (private) is something stunning.
I loved having breakfast at their restaurant as the morning light and peaceful of the place is amazing.
The staff is super nice, very friendly and always looking forward to help you.
We rented a moto to travel around the island so the fact the hotel is not in the busy city center was a plus for us.

Disliked · There isn’t anything that we didn’t love about the place. For us is quiet hard to sleep with day light entering the room as the windows don’t really have black outs, but I guess that’s the “price” you pay to be in the nature."
13,Buko Beach Resort,Juan, Spain,"Liked · Location, staff and restaurant are great!"
14,Buko Beach Resort,Tho, United States of America,"Liked · We booked the grand villa with the private pool with the beachfront. I highly recommend it. The Buko resort felt luxurious without losing the cultural authenticity of a Filipino beach town. From the bamboo rooms and furniture to the menu items. I really enjoyed have the best of both worlds during my stay here. My family loved starting our day at the restaurant with the spectacular view and great service. We also loved that the Buko team went above and beyond to celebrate my mom's birthday in addition to assisting us with our tours and adventures. P.S. go for the massages, they were amazing.

Disliked · My two minor suggestions for improvement would be to have a lock to the front door of the Grand Villa for safety reasons in general. The lighting in the living room was a bit too dim for night time so maybe adding a few more lamps would keep the lively atmosphere going. Other than that, it was an exceptional stay!"
15,Buko Beach Resort,Teodora, Romania,"Liked · Staff was amazing, great amenities and a really nice restaurant with good options"
16,Buko Beach Resort,Ana, Portugal,Liked · Location and amenities

If we return to El Nido - we will absolutely be staying here again."
