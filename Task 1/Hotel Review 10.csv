2,Panja Resort Palawan,Ryan, United States of America,Liked  The hospitality
3,Panja Resort Palawan,Orenia, Philippines,"Liked  Panja Resort surpassed all my expectations. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the resort's picturesque setting and serene ambiance. The staff was incredibly warm and accommodating, making me feel right at home. The rooms were comfortable and beautifully designed, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding nature. The on-site restaurant served mouthwatering dishes especially the calamares and shrimp. It's a must try. And the range of activities (like you can swim, you can go to the gym, spa for additional relaxation, and roofdeck for the view) available ensured there was never a dull moment. Panja Resort is a true haven for relaxation and rejuvenation. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking an unforgettable escape."

5,Panja Resort Palawan,Mihai-george, Romania,"Liked  Super great place to stay and relax. We really did enjoy our time here. The ambiance, the staff and the place itself is super nice."
6,Panja Resort Palawan,Danielle, New Zealand,"Liked  The staff here were incredible. We had a minor issue (miscommunication) with a couple of tour operators which we had booked through the hotel. They went above and beyond to sort the problem - it's very much appreciated. Our room also had a leak on the first night (stormy weather) so we were moved the next day and received complimentary cocktails.
The hotel is beautiful, free massages, lovely pool and stunning view. Plus free transfer to the airport and mall. Our favourite place we stayed in the Philippines. Thank you so much."
7,Panja Resort Palawan,Reigine, Philippines,"Liked  It was quiet and very relaxing. The spa was excellent and I kept going there for massages. They also provide complimentary transfers to the mall. The staff was accommodating too.

Disliked  They should have more variety of food offerings and better operation hours. Breakfast is really nice but after staying more than 4 nights it can be tiring to eat the same thing daily."

11,Panja Resort Palawan,Rhenzell, Philippines,"Liked  Everything was great! Staffs are very polite. Loved the food too!

Disliked  We experienced a few power interruptions on our first day but they weren't longer than 5 minutes."
12,Panja Resort Palawan,Schneider, Australia,"Liked  The hotel was incredibly beautiful and peaceful. It had great facilities, and you never had to leave! The perfect pitstop in Puerta Princessa. I would definitely stay here again.

Disliked  My only feedback is that there was only one bath towel (per person) in the room - it would be great if there was a hand towel, and towels were available for the pool. Other suggestions, which really didn't effect my stay nor make the resort any less fabulous would be to include a bathrobe and some milk/creamer in the room for tea/coffee."
13,Panja Resort Palawan,Alena, Russia,"Liked  It뭩 very nice, the staff are super friendly, polite and helpful. Calm place to stay.
