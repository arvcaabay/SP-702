1,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,József, Hungary,"Liked · That was our honeymoon 2nd resort to stay and they were extremely kind to us. That’s once in a lifetime place to visit.

Disliked · The pizza dough can be better (more Italian like)."
2,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Perez, United States of America,"Liked · Overall, we were pleased with the services that were provided. The staff were helpful & cordial. The property was well maintained & clean.

Disliked · We had an unsatisfied experience when we dined in for dinner. We ordered “crispy pata” which was overcooked, very tough to eat & chew."
3,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Jules, United States of America,Liked · This resort set the standard so high for their service staff that it is unmatched! Other hotels should train their staff on what it means to have excellent service! Cliff the water sports tour guide and life guard deserves all the recognition he can. He took excellent care of us and the rest of the staff made this trip an amazing and unforgettable experience
4,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Mary, Philippines,"Liked · The staff were always warm, friendly, accommodating and kind and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. The location was absolutely stunning and the grounds beautifully kept. Mark Dalita, our guide on the two days we toured the islands, is exceptional at what he does and genuinely thrilled at sharing his hometown with guests.

Disliked · It was a beautiful stay from start to finish. There was one blip on our final day but it didn't ruin the experience and was not the fault of the resort per se. Two Seasons allows the use of drones beachside, just not near the cottages on the island's tip, so as to respect privacy. The problem was a drone user with an extra large drone-- it was bothersome to those of us relaxing on the shore and going in the water. The drone's buzzing was loud and the beeping noises from the remote control were annoying. Also, I don't think any of my party (and most likely other guests) had any desire to be captured on video. I will include a suggestion to the resort to ban drones-- they are invasive."
5,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Laura, Colombia,"Liked · A paradise of its own, yet very near to Coron city. Beaches of powdered sand just for the the delight or it’s guests. No crowds of tourists. It’s waters are crystal clear due to its proximity to Linapacan, known as one of the planets most clearest waters on the planet"
6,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Gavin, Hong Kong,"Liked · Stunning setting, clear waters, palm trees, sunrises and sunsets visible from the beaches, warm greetings from staff, enjoyable experiences such as dining on the beach at sunset and water sports, private tours on offer, well kept grounds and staff on hand to tend to your needs. Don’t miss out on a drink in the jacuzzi bar at the pool area, be sure to book a private beach setup for dinner at sunset. for private tours, don’t miss out on Coron Island ultimate tour and the island hopping tour to Malcapuya Island and 2 others if you wish. the lunch provide at prearranged locations exceeded expectations. You can also take a walk across the sandbar at low tide to Bulog Dos Island and get your guide to tell you more and take photos for you, some of the staff are very talented with using iPhones so be sure to seek them out to get your postcard perfect shots. Also, the waters are full of marine life from baby sharks to stingrays and each time you pop in the clear waters is quite an experience to be surrounded by tropical fish. Overall, with blue sunny skies, you’ll feel in paradise and if you’re looking to stay anywhere in Palawan when in Coron, this is the place for you.

Disliked · Only things would be advice or suggestions for improvements such as ensuring adequate food supplies as items didn’t go out of stock and so affected food and drink choice from the menu. The spa was closed for renovation during our stay, but you could do a massage in your room. I would like to have seen a setup outside overlooking the waters for this in fact. make sure you apply insect repellent liberally as I came under attack with around 30 sand mite bites by the end of the trip. When the wind is up, the waters do get rough making boat trips back to Coron for the airport and to Coron Island for your tour rather rough, but the crew of your vessels know what they’re doing so you’re in good hands."
7,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Takehisa, Japan,"Liked · The buffet had a wide selection of foods to choose from. Everyone had what they wanted.

Disliked · The menu for lunch or dinner seems quite monotonous. Lunch and dinner could have different menus."
8,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Kimberly, United Kingdom,"Liked · The level of customer service was next level. Our room was beautiful - we stayed in the Sandbar Bungalow, but due to the typhoon, we were not able to use the plunge pool or really sit out, but thankfully the room was beautiful enough for us to just enjoy inside. Unfortunately, typhoon Paeng affected our trip and canceled our flights out of Coron. However, we got engaged (yay!) and despite things not going to plan, the hotel staff did everything they could to ensure that we felt safe and helped us enjoy our stay no matter the weather. They helped us celebrate our engagement as best we could and made it feel so special. They really went above and beyond to help us book our next flights out and ensure we had a place to stay another night. They immediately told us as soon as we were able to leave the mini island and take the boat to the main island, and even secured a room for us (at a very reasonable price) at their sister hotel - The Two Seasons Bayside Resort. The room we had was amazing - it was their Panorama Suite - and the service there was just as exceptional. We couldn't have been more appreciative of all the staff, especially Dana at the Two Seasons Island Resort. Thank you to all the staff and Resort Manager. We hope to visit again in the future!

Disliked · The Typhoon! But that obviously cannot be helped but the hotel made us feel very safe and assisted us with everything."
9,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Grace, South Korea,"Liked · Food was great, staff are extra friendly, the beach is kind of small but still beautiful. Loved the free kayak etc and also worth visiting the Bulog Sandbar. Very clean and the pools were great too. My three kids and we loved it."

15,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Ray, United Kingdom,"Liked · beautiful resort, staff were great but bear in mind the Philippines is not as advanced as other places in the world with service and hospitality

Disliked · the food could be improved to include and focus on more fresh produce rather than imported goods that suit tourists as the fresh items were the most delicious"
16,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Theresa, Philippines,"Liked · The breakfast spread is ok...their ala carte meals are not all good..we ordered adobo but it taste like chicken bistek....we order 2 lobster and ask for lemon butter sauce....the sauce came in like mayonnaise and butter....they need to improve on their food as it is the only thing you eat when in the island...the inasal, crispy pork liempo and inihaw na liempo is good....the ensalada (lunch in the beach was good)...the roasted chicken for breakfast was good...and of course the 4 cheese pizza....otherwise nothing is serve extra special....with the cost....should be at par....
the staff are good noella, rommel, johnny, jojo, arjo and the speed boat operators are good....

Disliked · the food...."
17,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Edwin, United States of America,"Liked · Great beach area for swimming and snorkeling. Excellent staff and service.

Disliked · Resorts private tour food can be elevated for the price they charge. Only had 1 entree choice for each person and not impressive with the choices . I’m comparing to the 3rd party tour company we went for our next tour . 3rd party tour company also had great tour guides and food is excellent with a variety of seafood ."
18,Two Seasons Coron Island Resort,Empalmado, United States of America,"Liked · The place and the food were of impeccable quality which reflects its prices. The room we stayed in is clean, organized, and nicely decorated (that rain shower brings back memories of when I played outside when it was raining). Hot and cold showers are also available. The staffs are very accommodating and they will always observe a kind attitude toward guests.

Disliked · Food prices were a bit pricey."
