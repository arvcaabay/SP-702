2,The Funny Lion - Coron,Francesca, United Kingdom,"Liked · The staff were the most incredibly wonderful people I ever had the pleasure to meet. It was my last night in Coron and actually my birthday. They realised and gave me the most gorgeous birthday celebration. The staff go above and beyond and such an asset to the hotel.
The room was so comfy, had everything I needed. I hadn’t realised breakfast was included so missed it before my transfer. The restaurant made me up a box of breakfast to take with me. I was so grateful.
A gem in a colourful fun town! Would thoroughly recommend."

4,The Funny Lion - Coron,Laura, Australia,"Liked · Wow… this place was something else that I have never experienced before! There was so many little touches that made their service amazing - from the evening cookies, handling all baggage, organising washing and tours and complimentary gifts. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful and accomodating. The rooms and pools were so clean and lovely too - they decorated our honeymoon bed so fancy! We will definitely be back!

Disliked · If we had to pick on one thing, their lunch/dinner restaurant service was a little bit slow and some menu items were hit and miss. The breakfast was great though."

15,The Funny Lion - Coron,Barrientos-knapp, United States of America,"Liked · The Funny Lion was a last minute booking when our El Nido flights got cancelled. So we came to Coron four days earlier than we planned. This was literally booked one day in advance. And we lucked out. What we loved especially was the hospitality! The staff was EXCEPTIONAL. Jen at the front desk was super lovely and helpful to us. This place is geared toward adults, but even our kids (15, 8) loved it here. They agree that the staff was wonderful! Everyday they gave complimentary snacks in the afternoon. And complimentary juices and fruit. Large refillable water bottles as well. Our kids got the “Cub” room that can sleep three, overlooking the more shallow pool (with jacuzzi) My husband and I got the Mara room which is next to their deeper pool in a more quiet spot of the hotel. It was the best room, so relaxing. Good wifi!! Very clean. Rooftop bar with two jacuzzis! Saturdays they have a buffet dinner with a lovely band. We cannot say enough great things about this place."
16,The Funny Lion - Coron,Aldridge, United Kingdom,"Liked · The staff were wonderful people who really took care of us. There were so many small touches that all added up to make such a difference - the offer to take our bags, the complimentary water and snacks by the pool, complimentary drinks on rainy days, engagement from staff, recommendations on activities or places, and so much more! The food in the restaurant was delicious and good value for money. The Massages were excellent. I could go on.

Disliked · We had 2 vegetarians in our group, who struggled to find very much that was suitable to them which was unfortunate"
17,The Funny Lion - Coron,Lutchie, United Kingdom,"Liked · Staff

Disliked · Food at the restaurant is expensive. Recommend eating outside."
18,The Funny Lion - Coron,Juliet, United Kingdom,"Liked · The Funny Lion was a warm and welcoming oasis just outside the hustle and bustle of Coron town. The staff were incredibly helpful and went above and beyond assisting us with your bookings and transfers. We felt very valued here. We also loved the live music evening and made frequent trips to the spa for massages which were the best we’ve ever had.

Disliked · We really enjoyed the food at The Funny Lion but we didn’t like the taste of the oil used for deep drying - it gave the fries a coconut flavour."
19,The Funny Lion - Coron,Peter, United States of America,"Liked · Wonderful property with the highlight being the staff - shout outs to Ian and Chris Kim and Jay! My wife and I stayed here for a week and couldn’t get the entire week off work so we had a bit of a workcation and the first room we were in didn’t have the best internet (the speeds were fine but not very stable) and they were kind enough to upgrade us to a villa and we had great internet/wifi connection the rest of our stay! So if you need to work during your stay, you should opt to pay for villa
The breakfast was included each morning and was a great buffet style that alternated each day and everything was pretty delicious. I enjoyed the coffee a lot which I think was a local brew. The roof top bar had great pizza and a beautiful view with two jacuzzis to relax in - the drinks were also fantastic and all the cocktails were tasty, and the bartender knew what I meant when I asked for less sweet, they delivered (no pun!) Speak of, room service from the restaurant was very good and I enjoyed the burger a lot.
Would definitely stay here again if/when we’re back in Coron!

Disliked · Not many complaints - the wifi was challenging at first but the staff was so accommodating and wonderful to upgrade us to a villa to have a better connection. We did have to ask a few time for certain housekeeping requests - like our sheets changed rather than made over but very minor inconveniences in an overall wonderful stay."
20,The Funny Lion - Coron,Ken, Canada,"Liked · Breakfast was great, a lot of options to choose from and the staff always greet you with a smile."
