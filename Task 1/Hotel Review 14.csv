8,Bacau Bay Resort Coron,Virnaliz, United Kingdom,"Liked · We were welcomed by nice staff with welcome drinks. For free breakfast, there’s variety of options (i recommend that you try PANDESAL-the best filipino bread). The room that we had was huge with very comfortable beds and loads of pillows, and the bathroom was also a good size and has great power of shower. The amenities are lovely, there’s a bar near the sea/pier (bacau’s own pier) where you can watch sunset. In the afternoon, they provide all the guests with cookies/simple delights with a card from the owner. Overall, it was a short but sweet and lovely stay. My partner and i had a wonderful time! I would definetely recommend Bacau Bay to my relatives and friends, one of the best resorts i’ve been! Thank you to all the staff!!"
