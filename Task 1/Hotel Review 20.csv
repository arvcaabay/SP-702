2,Munting Paraiso,Peake, United Kingdom,"Liked · Setting and location was brilliant.
Staff were really friendly.

Disliked · Air conditioning unit could of been in a better position, in the room as was very warm during the night to try sleep."
3,Munting Paraiso,Maksim, Estonia,"Liked · Nice cottage with terrace and hammock
Friendly staff. Greeted with welcome drink, organized airport tranfer (300 pesos one way)- nice big van, perfectly on time.
Good and reasonably priced food in on site restaurant.

Disliked · Wifi connection is slow, signal unstable-on and off.
Soundproof is not good- could hear all neighbours talks on their terraces.
Pool has great hanging chairs over the water but water itself is not clean at all- it was not circulating and looked like a soup. Decided to skip swimming.
Lots of mosquitos outside, so could not spend much fime on the terrace, which looks comfy and really nice."
4,Munting Paraiso,Ingrid, Belgium,"Liked · The people , it was very quite and only 300m from the Prestine beach. There were only some local people swimming and some fisherman getting ready to go fishing so not touristy at all. I loved it. The foid in the restaurant was excellent food.

Disliked · It was a bit far ( 3 KM) from the center so in the evening there was nothing to do.
The WiFi in the room was very unstable. You needed to stay outside in order not to be interrupted."

6,Munting Paraiso,Justine, United Kingdom,"Liked · The hotel really exceeded our expectations. They offered airport pickup and drop off 300 pesos each way which was a really good price and also convenient as it was our first time in Puerto Princesa/Palawan. The driver was easy to find in the airport arrivals area and he was very helpful and nice. When we got to the hotel, the reception staff were really friendly and told us all the information we needed, including letting us know about tourist activities like city tour packages, massages, island hopping etc. They also had a golf cart to help take us and our luggages to our rooms which was really helpful because the property was bigger than expected. The rooms were also very spacious and the shower room too. One of the best parts was definitely the nature and vibe of the hotel. The rooms were basically like mini cottages with your own outside seating area including a hammock which was my favourite part, we loved to use it every day and night to relax, drink, have a nice sit after dinner etc. The outdoor area was surrounded by the beautifully landscaped gardens; there were beautiful plants like bamboos, a massive overhanging tree, snake plants etc and it looked even more beautiful when it rained which it did a couple times during our stay. Another great part of the hotel was the restaurant. There was a lot of food on the menu, including delicious classic Filipino dishes but also pasta, sandwiches etc. They had amazing mango and calamansi smoothies, beer, and nicely made cocktails. The restaurant staff were nice&friendly also. We also booked a city tour package for 700pesos each which was a good price because we went to many sites around PP, including our favourite the Crocodile farm getting to see the massive crocs and holding a baby one too, the tour guide was also friendly and funny :) We also booked a massage and the masseuse came to our room which was convenient. Everything, from scenery to service, was excellent. Overall, an unforgettable experience.

Disliked · Not much to dislike, maybe just that the wifi voucher you're given is only allowed for one device so couldn't use it for my laptop but wasn't a big deal since I just used my personal hotspot on my phone whenever I needed it."

8,Munting Paraiso,Bram, Philippines,"Liked · I recently had a pleasant stay at this establishment. The room provided ample space, and the bed was comfortable, allowing for a good night's sleep. I appreciated the presence of a kitchen area and a proper refrigerator, which added convenience to my stay. Also, everything was in good shape (unfortunately, that is not so obvious here in the Philippines). The location is good, close to the airport and there are many day trips that will pick you up. Overall, it was a positive experience, and I would recommend it.

Disliked · I didn't like that there were many, many mosquitoes. So come prepared and bring a repellant!"
