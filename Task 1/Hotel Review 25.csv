17,Aziza Paradise Hotel,Adiel, Israel,"Liked  The staff was great and so welcoming. Breakfast had all the necessary ingredients and they cooked eggs and pancakes by request.
The pool was so beautiful and the temperature of the water was just perfect for a hot and sunny day. Location was great as well, close to everywhere by tuktuk and there was a massage place and a convenient store right in front of the hotel. The room was specious and overall clean.
Beds were comfortable and large. And a special thanks to Adam the bartender who made us feel so welcome with a great service and smile.

Disliked  They were ants everywhere in the room even though we did not leave any food laying around. The sink faucet slashed everywhere each time we opened it. And the water in the toilet sometimes would not go down the drain.

20,Aziza Paradise Hotel,Felino, United Arab Emirates,"Liked  The hotel team were very attentive and helped us out whenever they could.
Our stay would have not been complete without doing the daily excursions which was only possible with the professional help of reservation agent Jessica, from the time I booked to the time we arrived she had organized exactly what we needed to have a great experience and she exceeded that.

Disliked  The smell of mold is what really needs to be taken care of as this could be a health hazard for present and future guests."
