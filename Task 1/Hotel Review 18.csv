1,Seda Lio,Nathan, United Kingdom,Liked · Perfect location private beach. There are other restaurants close by up the beach if you want to try other places as well as the hotel restaurant. We stayed for a special occasion and had the private meal on the beach in an evening and it didn’t disappoint! The staff are so friendly and happy to help with anything you need. Perfect place to relax

9,Seda Lio,Abigail, Philippines,"Liked · The place is a paradise. It is very close to the beach where we watched the sunset on our first day in El Nido. The tours also have access thru the beach so it was easier for us since we have an infant, a preschooler and 2 seniors. We also enjoyed the pool. The service was great. We arrived at 9:00am and they allowed us an early check in. Someone also assisted us with the check in the moment we arrived at the lobby. Our rooms are clean and can easily access the garden and pool area.

Disliked · Niknik… i have too many bites. i’d like to suggest that citronella, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil
