Nacpan Beach Resort,Jozef, Slovakia,"Liked  We loved accomodation, restaurant, staff and their food. The atmosphere is very nice there incl. dogs, we loved, Mr. Arthur, manager is doing his job excellent. Thank you Arthur, Jozef & Dana

Disliked  Nik-nik on the beach. Too many bites we were affected there. Bites problems insist more than month. We know very well, what we are writing about..."
Nacpan Beach Resort,Ann, United States of America,"Liked  Pool

Disliked  Dog around while eating"
Nacpan Beach Resort,Maksim, Estonia,"Liked  Very beautiful place with its own strip of beach.
Spacious room, high ceiling, comfy bed, fridge with free drinks.
Very friendly and smiley staff. Helped quickly and smoothly with all the concerns.
Nice restaurant with live music and great waiters. Pork bbq skewers are really amazing.

Disliked  Street dogs literally everywhere. Running laps in the garden, greeting you under your chair and tables in resto, rolling under your sunbeds on the beach etc. Its not hygienic and very sad that staff just ignores them instead of trying to get this under control.
Roads in the area are totally broken and after heavy rain are not safe for driving. Would be good if hotel management try to fix the road at least in front of the hotel before someone gets injurured upon arrival.
There is nothing else in the area, so after few days felt bored even though hotel and beach are really nice."
Nacpan Beach Resort,Tessie, Canada,"Liked  Lots of choices and great breakfast buffet: very helpful staff

Disliked  Late arrival of shuttle for pick up"
Nacpan Beach Resort,Amy, United Kingdom,"Liked  Breakfast was lovely, albeit a little limited. Location was perfect for the beach. The staff here were impeccable! Lee Ann in the restaraunt was wonderful, as were Alvin on reception and another lady whose name I didn't manage to catch. They were all so personal and remembered our names. We ended up staying longer due to a storm and they couldn't have been more helpful.

Disliked  The food is rather limited, if you were staying here for longer than a week, it would get a bit samey. And there are limited options for alternative food."
Nacpan Beach Resort,Lee, Singapore,"Liked  Staff were exceptionally attentive, arranging transport for us and even offering us a voucher for the resort's restaurant when we were stuck indoors on a rainy day. Room was clean and everything worked well. Had a wonderful, restful break here."
Nacpan Beach Resort,Tony, United States of America,"Liked  Staff are exceptionally courteous and helpful.

Disliked  Beds are too low especially for seniors and people with disabilities."

Nacpan Beach Resort,Omar, United Arab Emirates,"Liked  beautiful location and good f&b and best staff

Disliked  amenities could be improved"
Nacpan Beach Resort,Edo, Israel,Liked  Clean and very spacious room equiped with all the amenities you need including slippers. Hot shower with great pressure. Right at the beach and has sunbeds. Breakfast buffet was fantastic with many choices and unlimited coffee. Also the hotels restaurant has great options both for lunch and dinner (last order for dinner is 9 pm). They serve happy hour as well from 4 pm to 6 pm. The staff was really kind and generous they upgraded our room for free. Great massages from the hotel. We highly recommend staying at this resort.
Nacpan Beach Resort,Jennifer, United Kingdom,"Liked  The location is stunning, Napcan beach is a beautiful beach unspoilt by mass tourism and with the most amazing sunsets. The hotel staff were very lovely and helpful and housekeeping did a great job. It was nice to be able to use the pool at the glamping as an option. The room was one of the largest we stayed in our whole trip and the aircon was very efficient (the room could benefit from some furniture to unpack into though, like a chest of drawers). We had a mountain view room which had lovely views out to the back and was quiet and peaceful.

Disliked  For me, the hotel is really let down by the breakfast and restaurant. I would have otherwise given it 10/10 but this knocked it down.
The restaurant is tired and run down and in need of some love. It had quite a sad vibe to it and although service was fine, it wasn't great. The breakfast was a buffet which I don't think really works well outdoors in that heat. There were melted plates of food with flies and ants on them every time we went and it was hard to find something hygienic to eat. I am not sure why they do not offer a smaller a la carte breakfast menu to avoid this issue. They did not offer any coffee or tea to order, just had a flask of instant coffee out.
The menus are very dirty and sticky, please clean or replace them!
The dogs at the restaurant need to be controlled. I understand the hotel say they are trying to address this issue, but I saw little evidence of this, just the odd spray of water here and there from some staff. There is a regular pack of dogs there and when people feed them from the table the staff turn a blind eye. I was afraid to eat there after a dog started growling at me under the table and acting unpredictably and we regularly were surrounded my dogs scratching fleas and sandflies over us.
It was such a shame, as if not for the restaurant this would have been a perfect stay, as the actual hotel is lovely. I would not chose to go back until these issues have been sorted."

Nacpan Beach Resort,Benjamin, United States of America,"Liked  1) Wow what a resort! The rooms were super unique and the views from the third floor sea side rooms are breathtaking.
2) Senmai restaurant was excellent and every dish we ordered was delicious. They even do brick oven pizza which was a save for us.. our 4 year old son is very picky about what he eats. Of course the local dishes are great as well.. and during our week stay we tried them all!
3) The beach front which you can walk to right outside of the resort is one of the best beaches I have been to in my life. Its private so not alot of people.
4) Service was exceptional from check in to check out.. kudos to the entire team!"
