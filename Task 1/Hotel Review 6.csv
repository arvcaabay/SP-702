6,Astoria Palawan,Ashish, South Korea,"Liked  Breakfast, fireshow during dinner, swimming pool"
7,Astoria Palawan,Olga, United Arab Emirates,"Liked  This one 5 starts hotel near Puerto Princesa. But I am not sure that we can call it 5 start hotel in our regular understanding.
But let me start with the advantages :
* big layout with a lot of activities : fire show in the evening, there is a small water park, good restaurant, there are much space to walk.
* friendly staff
* nice reception zone and beautiful territory

Disliked  The beach was closed while we were staying in the hotel. Guard said that this is because jelly fish season, but I believe that they had managed to do something if they would have wanted.
But at the same time you can swim in other beaches on the island. It is quite strange.
We faced with unpleasant situation with the water part. It's possible to visit it only once per stay, and it opens at 9.00.
We came at 9.20 and the entrance was closed. They said that the cashier has not come. It was odd, because we live in this hotel and they had allowed us if they would have wanted and then to sort out everything. At the end we came to the water park only after 30 minutes of waiting. I dont think that its a good service.
The renovation is not new, scratches in the bathroom, on the furniture"

14,Astoria Palawan,Maria, United States of America,"Liked  Breakfast very good
And staff very polite very friendly helpful"
15,Astoria Palawan,Philip, Singapore,"Liked  Staff were incredible. very good gym.

Disliked  My wife got food poisoning. It was definitely from the hotel because we did not eat anywhere else.
And you can only go in the water park one time. We thought it was part of the hotel and free every day."
16,Astoria Palawan,Marjet, Netherlands,"Liked  The staff and teh kids liked the waterpark. The entertainment team was very nice and offered us extra access. Since for us it was not clear that you one got 1 or 2 times access to the park when i booked it.

Disliked  The food is not so goed (but thats everywhere in PHP) When you eat a la carte, the waiting time is gigantic and the bring dishes at different times."
17,Astoria Palawan,Alexandre, Singapore,"Liked  Rooms are big with all the ammenities needed. Bed is also very comfty and everything clean and new. Terrasse in front of the room is nice for snack, apero or just to relax.
Breakfast in the morning has plenty of options and food is very nice. Also the free option for one entry at the water park is nice. There are kayaks, SUP or bikes at disposal for free and three different pools.

Disliked  Check-in process is very long and complicated. They recently opened a new building and moved the check-in there, with the old checkin only for check-outs. As in many hotels in the Philippines staff is super friendly but rather incompetent and super process-oriented.
Restaurant takes forever, so order at least 45min in advance to be sure to get it on time.
Despite zero waves and only knee-deep water the ""lifeguards"" don't leave you in the water. Everyone uses a different excuse ""jellyfish"", ""sharp rocks"" or dangerous shells. It seems that they just don't want anyone in the sea not to bother watching people there. Also the pool was not cleaned. There was a slimy cover on all stones and areas in the pool. I guess the pump was not working."
18,Astoria Palawan,Gary, United States of America,"Liked  Brunch

Disliked  Wanted the pool but under construction"
19,Astoria Palawan,Tatiana, Australia,"Liked  The staff and food was great ??

Disliked  The water park was not operative , and the website didn't mentioned this. So it was a big lack"
20,Astoria Palawan,Christopher, United States of America,"Liked  The property was clean and the staff very helpful when they are available.

Disliked  We had one night where we attempted to order room service 3 times but nobody came."
