All staff members made us feel so welcome and helped us book our accommodations such as transportation and excursions. We also truly enjoyed the food at BAYA Resto Lounge. The location is also perfect! We had the most amazing stay here. Two Seasons Coron Bayside exceeded our expectations. Thank you for making our trip truly unforgettable.
7,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Howarth, United Kingdom,"Liked · Stunning views from the pool area which looks over the sea/islands. Convenient location next to the ferry port if you wanted to travel elsewhere. Pool, gym & rooms are excellent - good water pressure in the shower. Exceptional staff who cannot do enough for you - super helpful when booking a tricycle and trips! Amazing food in the restaurant with attentive staff. Cannot recommend this hotel enough!

Disliked · Our room did not overlook the bay which we would have preferred & it’s about 1k from the shops (not many)."
8,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Delight, United States of America,Liked · Staff are incredibly polite
9,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Widad, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · Very well located with an amazing view on the bay. The restaurant, the room, the staff, the pool, all was great."
10,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Maria, Canada,"Liked · Panoramic suite is amazing
Disliked · My flight with airswift was cancelled because of maintenance repair . If the plane prior to us had to make an emergency landing cuz the propeller busted and was not working , I think there was warrant for airswift to do maintentence repair with all the planes . In saying this we weren’t able to go to coron because all flights were grounded for 5 days. I had payed already for the panoramic suite the day our flight was cancelled hence we missed one night stay . Despite airswift giving us a certificate of cancellation and providing receipts we had payed for our night stay , the hotel refused to give a refund which was totally disappointing and disgusting cuz it was not our fault . You would thing they would be understanding and give refund … I was wrong. I totally enjoyed our only night stay the day we were able to get to stay which was the next day . Hotel is very nice but because of this experience I will not stay there again . We’ve booked in hotels with no problems of refunds when flights were cancelled . It was a very frustrating event ."
11,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Hogben, United States of America,"Liked · The hotel is really clean and after spending three nights in a place that did not have air conditioning, it was a luxurious change."
12,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Annalyn, United States of America,"Liked · the property itself is classic

Disliked · the location is surrounded by unattractive neighborhood"
13,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Phoenicia, United States of America,"Liked · The staff is excellent friendly and thoughtful. Me and my husband take vacations quiet often and this is the only place that asked us the night before what time we will be checking out, so that they could prepare and pack our breakfast for us. We checked out around 5am, and we were able to leave with hot breakfast, which helped a lot.

Disliked · The only thing we didn’t like was that we missed checking in the first night we were supposed to be there, due to a delayed flight. We booked three nights and only stayed for two nights. The manager asked us to provide proof of the delayed flight, which we ended up emailing to her before we checked out, but the manager never bothered replying or acknowledging our email."
14,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Love, Philippines,"Liked · Very clean

Disliked · elevator was under maintenance. It was such a hassle to use the stair going up and down to the forth floor"
15,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Simone, Australia,"Liked · We loved staying at Two seasons. The room was pretty spacious and very clean. we had some amazing views of the bay. The pool was also amazing and we got some good use out of the gym (although the setup in there is reasonably basic). The dinner at the restaurant at the hotel was also delicious.

Disliked · The breakfast was fine but nothing special - we ordered poached eggs 2 days in a row and they took about 30 minutes to come.. coffee and some of the local food options were delicious though"
16,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Juan, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · amazing location, beautiful sunset view, pool and friendly staff"
17,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Daniel, United States of America,"Liked · It was nice for a change (for us at least) to stay at a hotel with a 5-star quality look and feel. The amenities were great, including the pool. The gym was sufficient for my purposes (just free weights, a treadmill, maybe another cardio machine). The a la carte food and drink was decent and not too overly priced for a hotel of this caliber.
The staff was also very professional and polite. They remembered my name throughout my short 2-night stay, and were always very helpful.

Disliked · I know this isn't entirely on them, but they are associated. The private tour I got through the hotel (which is great that you can charge to your room btw) was on time to pick me up from the hotel, but then we sat on the boat and waited for over 45min, close to an hour on the boat itself in the harbor just waiting for the tour guide. It's just not something that I would expect when you knowingly pay an upcharge by booking through the hotel. It was about 200 dollars for an ""8 hour island escapade tour"" that had me sitting on a boat in the harbor waiting for the guide for almost 1 of those 8 hours.
Location is also not too central, though it's only about a 20min walk into town. You'd think it would be more quiet but there was a bar nearby that you could hear at night.
Lastly, the included breakfast was subpar for what I would expect from this caliber of hotel. Certainly acceptable, but just did not have many traditional options. Though I tend to try to eat traditional food on my travels - they did have waffles, pancakes, and an omelet station so if you eat mostly western, you should be fine."
18,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Edgar, United States of America,Liked · Very nice and relaxing place to stay.
19,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Fernanda, Canada,"Liked · cleanliness, beautiful pool area, super friendly and nice staff, there is a gym and nice rooms with balcony. highly recommend

Disliked · for breakfast not many continental breakfast option ( example: no yogurt, croissants, cakes, pies )"
20,Two Seasons Coron Bayside Hotel,Karen, Ireland,"Liked · The staff were amazing and very helpful. Food was great. Lovely breakfast. Rooms very clean. Tours were well organised. Great gym .. one night after 10pm when restaurant was closed and we wanted cold bottled water one of the staff took off on his motorbike and got 3 bottles of cold water for us

Disliked · Gym could do with a selection of lighter weights… 3,4,5 kg… had to share a lot during a workout"
