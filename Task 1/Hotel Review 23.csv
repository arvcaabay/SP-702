10,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Hamish, Australia,"Liked · pool, waterslide, breakfast and the staff

Disliked · still very much a soft opening, needs to be better advertised that way. the waits on the restaurant was very long"
11,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Elizabeth, Germany,"Liked · The friendly hotel staffs that made our stay bearable. They did their job well even and always smiling inspite of stressful times. They all deserve salary raise from the hotel management sitting comfortably in Manila. Location is nice and how we wish the management will do more to preserve the Mangrove forests there and not to put up expensive Water Villas on it. Please get rid of the garbage near the Water Villas. The pool is lovely. Kudos to the guy cleaning on the pool. Love the shower because of the great water pressure.

Disliked · Our room smells moldy and one can see molds in the bathroom. Very expensive for a soft-opening! Breakfast is not at all a 5 star hotel level. The hotel staffs cannot do anything about it. They can only prepare what the management will provide for them. Notbmuch space to put/hang clothes. For the late cleaning of rooms, I am not complaining. I only pity these guys who are the only ones cleaning the whole hotel rooms. They deserve all the tips they got from us everyday. No ironing board and other basics. 5 star hotel? Definitely not."
12,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Marisa, South Africa,"Liked · The bed was very comfortable and the swimming pool was amazing.

Disliked · The hotel is a bit tired and things weren’t working as they should, the aircon sounded like an old tractor and many of the things listed to do, were not available."
13,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Salah, Saudi Arabia,"Liked · it’s clean spacious large swimming pool good food

Disliked · most of the facility is under construction only available is room restaurant and pool"
14,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Brian, United States of America,"Liked · Pool was great.

Disliked · Room was good, but bed was tough on my back. Room had a poor view of under renovation pond, lots of construction noise throughout the day. Food in restaurant was good, however, timing of food service was poor, for example two of us ordered dinner. Hers was served in :15 minutes, mine was served in :30 minutes. Cooks must be able to time their cooking so that all meals are completed and served at the same time. Cooks did not know how to cook eggs over easy. Most of the amenities did not seem available as it was under renovation. This was not disclosed during booking."
15,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Soren, Denmark,"Liked · The room was very good and the direct access to the pool was excellent.

Disliked · The meaning of “Soft opening” should have been explained on the website. It turns out that most of the resort was undergoing major renovations with most of the facilities shut down and noise from the construction of a new major wing (5 stories high) all day.
I think that a major discount should have been given for the inconveniences, which by the way will last for all of 2023."
16,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,, Australia,"Liked · Everything was smooth from the check in to buffet breakfast, staff went above and beyond to meet our needs"

19,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Marty, United States of America,Liked · Loved the Water Villa suite!
20,Princesa Garden Island Resort and Spa,Beach, United States of America,"Liked · The pool is amazing and huge! They have many rooms with direct pool access from your room slider. The on-site Italian restaurant is great too. The room was very clean and neat. The staff was extremely kind and helpful.

Disliked · slight construction noise from the new tower they are building, but it wasn't really a problem. The breakfast buffet is marginal in availability, variety.and slow service staff, but again, this is a soft opening, so be patient."
