1,Matinloc Resort,Jovy, Philippines,Liked · A paradise resort with excellent services. The staff is so friendly and approachable...The foods are awesome all are delicious??? We recommend this place to our newlywed couple for their honeymoon...
2,Matinloc Resort,Mikael, Norway,"Liked · Excellent staff. Excellent food. Special thanks to ""Jedd"" for making our stay extra special ?? Location is so amazing! We had some issues at check in, but they took care of it right away. We had fun in the pools, karaoke and kayak to the nearby beach for some private snorkeling. Some other reviews mention bad food, and we disagree strongly. We tried a lot of different food and everything was amazing. We usually asked for whatever the chef recommended that day.

Disliked · The resort is huge, but a big part of it seems abandoned."

7,Matinloc Resort,, Philippines,"Liked · Under recent health protocol restrictions, heading to El Nido meant navigating fluctuating multiple tourism and local requirements. But it was all so worth it from the time we landed until the end of our stay. Our deep thanks to Jayson Guilalas for making magic happen with his team while wearing multiple hats . He picked us up from the airport, handled the boat ride process to Matinloc Island and upon arriving there, surprised us with fab news that we had been upgraded to a beach villa. We were Matinloc’s first guests after 11 months of Covid-19 shutdown so the resort was keen to show its best service ...which they did generously and flexibly. Because we were only 2 guests for 5 days, we pre-selected our meals from an extensive menu beforehand to make sense for procurement under the special circumstances. We weren’t disappointed — we enjoyed our vegetarian and pescatarian selections. The resort had its own fresh fish stocked by the jetty. Big thanks to Jonathan (F&B) who took such good care of us, consistently pro-active with ideas ie. dine in areas to watch the moon rise and on our last night, taking almost 2 hours to fix and decorate a special gazebo for our dinner! The spa wasn’t operational due to Covid-19 but we didn’t even look for it. The beach villa had generous proportions, and the other rooms we saw also reflected both thoughtful design and good size. In general, I was surprised at how well-constructed the buildings are, and really pleased at the availability of WiFi throughout. (It helps to have a Globe telco tower in the island too.) Great beach front for easy snorkeling and a white sand lagoon accessible via 5 min kayak. So for city executives looking to recharge and/or to Work-from-Wherever (versus WFH), check out Matinloc .... and do those emails and Zoom calls in spacious rooms with a gorgeous views, or with sand between your toes."
8,Matinloc Resort,Nasser, Saudi Arabia,"Liked · Quite place and good location, helpful staff

Disliked · Shortage of some food during my stay"
9,Matinloc Resort,Mary, United States of America,"Liked · The staff was the star of this resort. They were very nice, helpful, accommodating, and efficient. They provided us with privacy but anticipated whatever we needed and had it ready, sometimes even before we asked. The exclusive beach access was also great. Our beach villa was so comfortable and huge.

Disliked · The menu options for food were limited. If you stay longer than two days, you will most likely be eating the same things. And they were on the pricey side but that's expected for a luxury resort."
10,Matinloc Resort,Hatton, United Kingdom,"Liked · We loved the spacious beach bungalow....we viewed the tree houses they were top class. We loved the monkeys and that Christine come and got us when they arrived. Staff first class a dream island with fabulous views.

Disliked · We liked everything however if we was to suggest a little improvement.
Firstly the food is well presented but we would like to see some fresh food on the menu. Maybe some fish or a bbq of the evening. Also sea was a little choppy one morning which bought in some plastic and rubbish. We would like to see the rubbish collected and recycled. Other than that an absolutely beautiful resort."
11,Matinloc Resort,Mike, United States of America,"Liked · All meals were terrific, the location is breathtaking. A good opportunity to escape from the routine and peace the mind with astonishing views.

12,Matinloc Resort,Nicola, Philippines,"Liked · A beautiful resort with exceptional staff. The Pina-Coladas were fantastic (having added our own shot of rum).

Disliked · Many items were not available on the menu and food choice was limited but we expect this on an Island resort."

Disliked · The buffet breakfast should be improved with more varieties to choose from."
16,Matinloc Resort,Kerney, United States of America,"Liked · The infinity pool was beautiful with an ocean view but the food wasn't great and there were not so many selections. We ordered chicken adobo and the rice was so over cooked that it almost tasted like porridge.

Disliked · We had a good time in Matinlok. It's worth it for the money. Our villa was huge but it's only good for 2 people. We have to pay 10,000 pesos more for two extra people just for one day of stay."
