15,Cauayan Island Resort and Spa (El Nido),Melanie, United Kingdom,"Liked · It was a beautiful resort located on an amazing island. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the beach and pool were amazing. also the staff were wonderful - so kind, attentive and helpful. They offered to carry our sleeping 3 year old down from the sunset hike when she fell asleep!! We also enjoyed the snorkelling options - snorkelled with a turtle and baby reef sharks which was really cool.

Disliked · As it is on an island it is costly to get off the island to see Palawan. I would maybe consider offering shuttle transfers maybe with pick ups to those staying there as an option…"
