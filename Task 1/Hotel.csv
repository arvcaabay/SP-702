We want to express our deep gratitude for the warm welcome and exceptional kindness of the staff during our stay. Your hospitality truly made our experience, making our stay unforgettable.
The island itself is a true paradise. The natural beauty surrounding us was breathtaking, leaving us in awe of the splendor of every sunrise and sunset. Every corner of the island seemed to be painted by natureÂs hand.
The dining experience was a memorable culinary journey. The international variety and freshness of the produce delighted our taste buds at every meal. Each dish was a delight that reflected authenticity and care in the cuisine.
We look forward to returning to this piece of paradise and reliving these precious moments. Thank you for everything you did to make our stay unforgettable."

The rooms were clean and comfortable and the beach and pool were amazing. also the staff were wonderful - so kind, attentive and helpful. They offered to carry our sleeping 3 year old down from the sunset hike when she fell asleep!! We also enjoyed the snorkelling options - snorkelled with a turtle and baby reef sharks which was really cool.

Disliked Â· As it is on an island it is costly to get off the island to see Palawan. I would maybe consider offering shuttle transfers maybe with pick ups to those staying there as an optionÂ"

",72,David, United Kingdom,"Liked Â· I don't often write reviews but I had no choice but I felt compelled.
First of all I want to say the staff make this place exceptional, the effort and service goes far beyond what it should.
The photos on booking.com do not even come close to the beauty of this place, when you ride in on the boat which is the only way to access the resort, you will soon come to realise you made a superb choice.
There are only 5 bungalow style rooms at this resort, we stayed in the deluxe sea view room with the hanging egg chair for two nights, and then swiftly tried to book a further 3 nights but had to settle for one of the other rooms as it was booked, but they too are beautiful.
The effort put into the ambience and landscaping leading into the bungalows is Bali like, with a Buddhist feel, it's beautiful beyond words, it's magical.
We were lucky to have the whole hotel to ourselves the first two nights and the staff went to an amazing effort to make us our evening meal on the beach, the staff really do go above and beyond.
The darkness of what actually feels like an island, as it's shut off from the mainland makes the stars at night burst out, so beach walks with your partner are extra special! ( You will also have your own personal security guard in the form of the one of the resort dogs who will escort you up and down the beach???? Two sausage dogs max and Bella, and two island dogs, they are all so lovey and friendly) it was like a home from home.
The beach hosts tours from the mainland throughout the day at the lower end of the beach, so you get the occasional tourist looking to take some photos of the resort as it's very picturesque, but once the sun sets ( which you have a premium view of here ) you are alone on the beach/resort.
if you are looking for that desert island feel, this is the place.
Thank you all so much, matamang salamat po.

Disliked Â· Hard to find anything, but I guess my only disappointment was that other than the main deluxe room, all of the rooms do not have a door on the toilet/shower and has no extractor fan and all have large windows into the bedroom, so privacy using the bathroom is zero, I asked the staff to place a curtain for us.
I know this is trivial and won't bother most, but some things should remain private?? ????
The other thing to consider is this is the tropics so you will see bugs, ants, snakes and spiders just like the mainland of which we seen most days, especially if your looking for them haha."

They tidy the room every time you leave, bring breakfast to your terrace, and arrange the daybeds at the beach for you. Everyone there went out of their way to make sure we had a nice stay. The wifi in the room is good and the food is delicious. Since there are only a handful of rooms, you really feel like you have the whole place to yourself.

Your receive a very boutique and personalised experience which makes the privacy of the area and resort even the more special. The location is just beautiful and tucked away, so itÂs very peaceful. Initially when booking I thought the outlay/cost was expensive for the country, but now that we have been I would happily pay it again for the relaxation we got. When we have such busy lives it was easily the absolute best relaxation holiday we have had. We really enjoyed the boutique experience. It was exactly as described and would love to go again.

Disliked Â· It isnÂt a resort with all the amenities like pool etc, but I think with the staff/service/tranquility and not having all those people around it was even better and you donÂt really care. The beach is magic and our room had a bath and the day beds so it was exactly what we were looking for and as described."

",72,David, United Kingdom,"Liked Â· I don't often write reviews but I had no choice but I felt compelled.
First of all I want to say the staff make this place exceptional, the effort and service goes far beyond what it should.
The photos on booking.com do not even come close to the beauty of this place, when you ride in on the boat which is the only way to access the resort, you will soon come to realise you made a superb choice.
There are only 5 bungalow style rooms at this resort, we stayed in the deluxe sea view room with the hanging egg chair for two nights, and then swiftly tried to book a further 3 nights but had to settle for one of the other rooms as it was booked, but they too are beautiful.
The effort put into the ambience and landscaping leading into the bungalows is Bali like, with a Buddhist feel, it's beautiful beyond words, it's magical.
We were lucky to have the whole hotel to ourselves the first two nights and the staff went to an amazing effort to make us our evening meal on the beach, the staff really do go above and beyond.
The darkness of what actually feels like an island, as it's shut off from the mainland makes the stars at night burst out, so beach walks with your partner are extra special! ( You will also have your own personal security guard in the form of the one of the resort dogs who will escort you up and down the beach???? Two sausage dogs max and Bella, and two island dogs, they are all so lovey and friendly) it was like a home from home.
The beach hosts tours from the mainland throughout the day at the lower end of the beach, so you get the occasional tourist looking to take some photos of the resort as it's very picturesque, but once the sun sets ( which you have a premium view of here ) you are alone on the beach/resort.
if you are looking for that desert island feel, this is the place.
Thank you all so much, matamang salamat po.

Disliked Â· Hard to find anything, but I guess my only disappointment was that other than the main deluxe room, all of the rooms do not have a door on the toilet/shower and has no extractor fan and all have large windows into the bedroom, so privacy using the bathroom is zero, I asked the staff to place a curtain for us.
I know this is trivial and won't bother most, but some things should remain private?? ????
The other thing to consider is this is the tropics so you will see bugs, ants, snakes and spiders just like the mainland of which we seen most days, especially if your looking for them haha."

They tidy the room every time you leave, bring breakfast to your terrace, and arrange the daybeds at the beach for you. Everyone there went out of their way to make sure we had a nice stay. The wifi in the room is good and the food is delicious. Since there are only a handful of rooms, you really feel like you have the whole place to yourself. If you are planning a trip to El Nido , you cannot miss this place!"

Your receive a very boutique and personalised experience which makes the privacy of the area and resort even the more special. The location is just beautiful and tucked away, so itÂs very peaceful. Initially when booking I thought the outlay/cost was expensive for the country, but now that we have been I would happily pay it again for the relaxation we got. When we have such busy lives it was easily the absolute best relaxation holiday we have had. We really enjoyed the boutique experience. It was exactly as described and would love to go again.

Disliked Â· It isnÂt a resort with all the amenities like pool etc, but I think with the staff/service/tranquility and not having all those people around it was even better and you donÂt really care. The beach is magic and our room had a bath and the day beds so it was exactly what we were looking for and as described."

Snorkelling experience is out of this world. Very peaceful atmosphere at the sunset villas. Complimentary foot massage and treats on arrival were perfect and made us feel very welcome. Airport pickup and drop off service was fantastic.

Disliked Â· The food quality varied, and meat dishes tended to be pricey. The hotel's snorkel gear was subpar, with damaged and mismatched pieces. Had we relied on this we would not have had such a great experience. I suggest bringing your own equipment. Day trips were on the expensive side, especially compared to options on the main island, which deterred us from participating. We were pleased with our stay in one of the sunset villas, but were disappointed that the quality and atmosphere of other accommodations on the island did not match our experience. The staff housing appeared to be in poor condition, bordering on squalor, which made us feel uncomfortable. It's odd that access to Eagle's Point(highest place on the island) is limited to sunrise and sunset, and only by appointment, accompanied by the island's security personnel."

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we would definitely recommend to family and friends and we will happily return and look forward to it. The snorkelling was so much fun and there was so much to see. The food was very tasty and the service was very friendly. We loved being able to relax and have lunch on the beech and Gerrick (definitely spelt incorrectly) was exceptional who worked at the Dugong bar. We also had room service one of the nights and that was also a great option and a nice touch. Overall we canÂt fault our stay.

Disliked Â· My only issue was with the time it took to return the deposit held on my card at the start of our stay. I was emailing them 3 weeks after to see when this money would be returned to my card. I think this needs to be improved as we have never stayed anywhere else where this wasnÂt done immediately."

We had some issues prior to arrival, essentially you have to arrive at Coron airport by 4pm in order to make the transfer window to the island. we had to take two additional flights in order to make the time and arrived pretty annoyed. Fritz and the rest of the team went out of their way to look after us and really rectified the situation.
The staff were outstanding with lots of lovely touches (morning coffee delivered to your villa, complementary guided hike to a viewing point and a lovely turn down gift)."

The location was absolutely stunning and the grounds beautifully kept. Mark Dalita, our guide on the two days we toured the islands, is exceptional at what he does and genuinely thrilled at sharing his hometown with guests.

Disliked Â· It was a beautiful stay from start to finish. There was one blip on our final day but it didn't ruin the experience and was not the fault of the resort per se. Two Seasons allows the use of drones beachside, just not near the cottages on the island's tip, so as to respect privacy. The problem was a drone user with an extra large drone-- it was bothersome to those of us relaxing on the shore and going in the water. The drone's buzzing was loud and the beeping noises from the remote control were annoying. Also, I don't think any of my party (and most likely other guests) had any desire to be captured on video. I will include a suggestion to the resort to ban drones-- they are invasive."

DonÂt miss out on a drink in the jacuzzi bar at the pool area, be sure to book a private beach setup for dinner at sunset. for private tours, donÂt miss out on Coron Island ultimate tour and the island hopping tour to Malcapuya Island and 2 others if you wish. the lunch provide at prearranged locations exceeded expectations. You can also take a walk across the sandbar at low tide to Bulog Dos Island and get your guide to tell you more and take photos for you, some of the staff are very talented with using iPhones so be sure to seek them out to get your postcard perfect shots. Also, the waters are full of marine life from baby sharks to stingrays and each time you pop in the clear waters is quite an experience to be surrounded by tropical fish. Overall, with blue sunny skies, youÂll feel in paradise and if youÂre looking to stay anywhere in Palawan when in Coron, this is the place for you.

Disliked Â· Only things would be advice or suggestions for improvements such as ensuring adequate food supplies as items didnÂt go out of stock and so affected food and drink choice from the menu. The spa was closed for renovation during our stay, but you could do a massage in your room. I would like to have seen a setup outside overlooking the waters for this in fact. make sure you apply insect repellent liberally as I came under attack with around 30 sand mite bites by the end of the trip. When the wind is up, the waters do get rough making boat trips back to Coron for the airport and to Coron Island for your tour rather rough, but the crew of your vessels know what theyÂre doing so youÂre in good hands."

Our room was beautiful - we stayed in the Sandbar Bungalow, but due to the typhoon, we were not able to use the plunge pool or really sit out, but thankfully the room was beautiful enough for us to just enjoy inside. Unfortunately, typhoon Paeng affected our trip and canceled our flights out of Coron. However, we got engaged (yay!) and despite things not going to plan, the hotel staff did everything they could to ensure that we felt safe and helped us enjoy our stay no matter the weather. They helped us celebrate our engagement as best we could and made it feel so special. They really went above and beyond to help us book our next flights out and ensure we had a place to stay another night. They immediately told us as soon as we were able to leave the mini island and take the boat to the main island, and even secured a room for us (at a very reasonable price) at their sister hotel - The Two Seasons Bayside Resort. The room we had was amazing - it was their Panorama Suite - and the service there was just as exceptional. We couldn't have been more appreciative of all the staff, especially Dana at the Two Seasons Island Resort. Thank you to all the staff and Resort Manager. We hope to visit again in the future!

Disliked Â· The Typhoon! But that obviously cannot be helped but the hotel made us feel very safe and assisted us with everything."

Nice restaurant with live music and great waiters. Pork bbq skewers are really amazing.

Disliked Â· Street dogs literally everywhere. Running laps in the garden, greeting you under your chair and tables in resto, rolling under your sunbeds on the beach etc. Its not hygienic and very sad that staff just ignores them instead of trying to get this under control.
Roads in the area are totally broken and after heavy rain are not safe for driving. Would be good if hotel management try to fix the road at least in front of the hotel before someone gets injurured upon arrival.
There is nothing else in the area, so after few days felt bored even though hotel and beach are really nice."

",360,Jennifer, United Kingdom,"Liked Â· The location is stunning, Napcan beach is a beautiful beach unspoilt by mass tourism and with the most amazing sunsets. The hotel staff were very lovely and helpful and housekeeping did a great job. It was nice to be able to use the pool at the glamping as an option. The room was one of the largest we stayed in our whole trip and the aircon was very efficient (the room could benefit from some furniture to unpack into though, like a chest of drawers). We had a mountain view room which had lovely views out to the back and was quiet and peaceful.

Disliked Â· For me, the hotel is really let down by the breakfast and restaurant. I would have otherwise given it 10/10 but this knocked it down.
The restaurant is tired and run down and in need of some love. It had quite a sad vibe to it and although service was fine, it wasn't great. The breakfast was a buffet which I don't think really works well outdoors in that heat. There were melted plates of food with flies and ants on them every time we went and it was hard to find something hygienic to eat. I am not sure why they do not offer a smaller a la carte breakfast menu to avoid this issue. They did not offer any coffee or tea to order, just had a flask of instant coffee out.
The menus are very dirty and sticky, please clean or replace them!
The dogs at the restaurant need to be controlled. I understand the hotel say they are trying to address this issue, but I saw little evidence of this, just the odd spray of water here and there from some staff. There is a regular pack of dogs there and when people feed them from the table the staff turn a blind eye. I was afraid to eat there after a dog started growling at me under the table and acting unpredictably and we regularly were surrounded my dogs scratching fleas and sandflies over us.
It was such a shame, as if not for the restaurant this would have been a perfect stay, as the actual hotel is lovely. I would not chose to go back until these issues have been sorted."

2) Senmai restaurant was excellent and every dish we ordered was delicious. They even do brick oven pizza which was a save for us.. our 4 year old son is very picky about what he eats. Of course the local dishes are great as well.. and during our week stay we tried them all!
3) The beach front which you can walk to right outside of the resort is one of the best beaches I have been to in my life. Its private so not alot of people.
4) Service was exceptional from check in to check out.. kudos to the entire team!"

",264,Olga, United Arab Emirates,"Liked Â· This one 5 starts hotel near Puerto Princesa. But I am not sure that we can call it 5 start hotel in our regular understanding.
But let me start with the advantages :
* big layout with a lot of activities : fire show in the evening, there is a small water park, good restaurant, there are much space to walk.
* friendly staff
* nice reception zone and beautiful territory

Disliked Â· The beach was closed while we were staying in the hotel. Guard said that this is because jelly fish season, but I believe that they had managed to do something if they would have wanted.
But at the same time you can swim in other beaches on the island. It is quite strange.
We faced with unpleasant situation with the water part. It's possible to visit it only once per stay, and it opens at 9.00.
We came at 9.20 and the entrance was closed. They said that the cashier has not come. It was odd, because we live in this hotel and they had allowed us if they would have wanted and then to sort out everything. At the end we came to the water park only after 30 minutes of waiting. I dont think that its a good service.
The renovation is not new, scratches in the bathroom, on the furniture"

Breakfast in the morning has plenty of options and food is very nice. Also the free option for one entry at the water park is nice. There are kayaks, SUP or bikes at disposal for free and three different pools.

Disliked Â· Check-in process is very long and complicated. They recently opened a new building and moved the check-in there, with the old checkin only for check-outs. As in many hotels in the Philippines staff is super friendly but rather incompetent and super process-oriented.
Restaurant takes forever, so order at least 45min in advance to be sure to get it on time.
Despite zero waves and only knee-deep water the ""lifeguards"" don't leave you in the water. Everyone uses a different excuse ""jellyfish"", ""sharp rocks"" or dangerous shells. It seems that they just don't want anyone in the sea not to bother watching people there. Also the pool was not cleaned. There was a slimy cover on all stones and areas in the pool. I guess the pump was not working."

",46,Jessica, United Arab Emirates,"Liked Â· The resort is stunning and completely tucked away, yet only minutes from El Nido by speedboat. We had gorgeous views of the bay from our room, and ate the majority of our meals on the balcony because it was such a great setup. (Definitely eat as many Breakfasts in the room as possible!).
We had a villa with a pool, and I'd definitely recommend that type of room. The rooftop pool at Henri's was great as well, and the perfect place to watch sunset (make sure to go up for cocktails too). We ate dinner on the terrace to enjoy the fresh air, but the inside restaurant looked great as well.
The facilities were great - gorgeous pool that gets full sun at the entrance and main restaurant, and a decent gym and great spa - make sure to get a massage!
It's the people that really made it though, Claudia and Faith went above and beyond to make our stay memorable, from organizing our breakfasts, to customizing a private island hopping day, they did it all. We went out twice with Rio and Mark on the speedboat and had the best time - island hopping is a must, it's so stunning. Make sure to have lunch at their private lagoon (Cadlao lagoon) as well."

You get VIP treatment from the moment you step in El Nido, from their free airport transfer, warm welcome and very accomodating butlers. The hotel is aptly named because you feel like you're in a secret place where there is privacy and surrounded by nature.
I also enjoyed every food I had from their restaurant. Kudos to the kitchen staff and chef!
I was hesitant to book here at first because there were only a few reviews, but I found out later on that the resort was fairly new.

Disliked Â· The only thing I didn't like was the inaccessibility to the main town. You have to book a multicab or speed boat to leave the property. Although the process was easy and they were able to accommodate our request easily, I just wish there were other options."

It's no wonder this place is one of the best luxury boutique hotels in Asia. Sedrick (spelling) is an amazing tour guide as well. Every other person on a public or private tour was jealous of our guide for good reason.

Disliked Â· Currently only one choice for restaurant, but they are adding a second restaurant soon. It's not the most walkable resort due to the elevation, but the staff more than makes up for it by shuttling you where you need to go"

They went above and beyond by accommodating our very restrictive dietary requirements, making our experience seamless with early check in and late checkout, and planned memorable excursions the could be enjoyed by adults and my three year old (as well as a surprise birthday dinner). They have impressive attention to details that really make a family vacation - my daughter loved the pool toys. The two resident dogs, Warrior and Panda, also made our trip one to remember. We canÂt wait to come back."

",46,Seohee, South Korea,"Liked Â· This is one of the BEST PLACE that i've visited in mylife as life traveler.
Location: This hotel is located in very private island and bring you the most peaceful but vibrant place for your holiday.
Service: From the beginning of the journey, butlers are greeting us from the airport and care never ends even after I leave the places. Butlers and staffs are extremely friendly, taking care of you every place you are visiting and very thoughtful service - (the best was, when we got back from swimming/kayaking, they brought us cold tower to fresh us up!
Food: Henri's has the BEST VIEW from daytime till the evening. Sunset is the best from the top of the island and the food is really well organized and served with good quality.
Drinks: they do have lots of great options from cocktails, whiskey, wines. I loved the Mosco mule from the pool the most.
Facilities: Gym, Sauna, Pool (two places) and Tour service everything was over the expectation.
Staff: I've been to lots of 5star hotels and private resorts. staffs in Lihim was the BEST. I see their service is from their heart."

Incredible view from the balcony. Beach all to ourselves, cocktails whilst swimming in the pool, delicious food, free breakfast, a wonderfully romantic getaway resort and I can't wait to return. There's a town nearby with shops and food options as well as boats to the underground river. Very happy with our stay.

Disliked Â· The WiFi connection was unreliable and the TV wasn't connected to the internet but we weren't there to watch TV so not a big problem for us. If ordering room service you may have a few furry dog friends hanging around but if you like animals this isn't a problem they're just cute and hungry."

The resort has a small number of cottages which make it perfect, not overcrowded. The landscape all around is artistically designed and well manicured. Security 24/7. Have I mentioned the staff was superb? No hidden fees, my bill was correct down to the peso.

Disliked Â· A minor dislike, but not a reason for not coming back, was that the sea is ten steps away and no fish (seafood)on the menu. The restaurant should have been heavy on grilled fish(es), shrimp, calamari, squid, etc."

Staff for some reason put us on an upper floor when all the while I believe we were booked on the ground floor because of my 2 active children. Had to insist on my preferred location and Abby and Jake patiently accommodated our request, even showing us possible options. its been a beautiful customer experience especially for a travelling family.
Thank you Jake from housekeeping and Abby from reception, you've been amazing.
2. the unit facing the beach itself is paradise. waking up in the morning just few steps away from the beach with a well manicured garden...fabulous! (its petty, but the tap in front of each unit is superb, for a person with OCD, this little detail to keep the room tidy is spot on!.)
3. the unit itself (we stayed in 801 - beach villa B. the difference between A, B and C if i am not mistaken is having a powder room or just a simple bathroom..i think....but we were in B and thats been lovely) the room was spacious enough.
4. Location is perfect - we simply walk along the beach to the little center where few restaurants and little shops are.
5. its close to the subterranean river and zipline site... No need to get package or tour - simply go to the tourism office and pay for the trip yourself, boats are there too. for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) we only spent less than 3000 pesos for the trip to the underground river and 550 for each for the zipline.
6. breakfast is well presented with attentive but not intrusive staff - Edmond and team, thank you for the beautiful experience. (my kids loved their eggs benedict!)
7. food is also good with reasonable price as well. They have an amazing chef presenting Filipino dishes quite well (they have other options too).
8. i love it that its independent and not a hotel chain so you are kind of supporting smaller businesses but it is with a 5 star quality.

Disliked Â· its not hotels fault but just the presence of this insect called Nik-nik, like little blood suckers, am still healing from the bites after 3 weeks. they dont get turned off by mosquito repellants but we were told ""Off lotion"" is more useful.
so appreciate Ivan for giving us his cream... thats customer service on an extra mile..."

Disliked Â· The restaurant was great, and the food was excellent, however, the wine list was nonexistent. Apparently, somebody in charge believes that the only way to sell wine is by the entire bottle. This is a mistake, and one that I asked that they correct, but they seemed to care less. We were offered a choice of red, white, and rosÃ©. Each of these wines came from a nondescript winery in Spain. I was able to get a sample of the red wine and it was terrible. I recommend the staff spend just a small amount of time and acquire some wines from other places and the world, and that they pay attention to the fact that wine IS food, and it should be offered and paired with food appropriately. Ignoring this fact is unwise, but that is exactly what this resort has done and continues to do. Please fix this at once, then let me know and perhaps I'll return for another visit."

The in room massages were out of this world good. Food fantastic. Pool spotless. Huts well set out and very comfortable Sunset views stunning. Seamless transfers organised in complete luxury for our drive to Puerto Princesa
Not to mention the very special surprise we had waiting for us in our room to congratulate us on our honeymoon when we got there. Signed by all the staff

I was looking for this resort for a week, hesitant cause still pricey but well it was worth it with the service and the place was really relaxing. We are both easily get bitten by mosquito, itÂs just us so tht was our concern but they had the repellant everywhere, from the room and outside the property so it was good. The food was exceptionally great, my partner is a bit picky but in Buko beach he ate everything whatÂs on plate. I definitely recommend it if you want a relaxing moment."

I cannot express how truly incredible my husband and my stay was.
First off, the resort: just paradise! The cottages are beautiful, comfortable, have great AC, pool overlooking the beautiful beach, everything is so stunning and perfect. Quick ride less than 10 mins to El Nido town.
The restaurant: we ate here almost every meal and loved everything we had!
The staff: ABOVE AND BEYOND! Staff treated us like family, helped us take care of literally everything we could need. Without going into too much detail, my husband and I are from the United States and were in a motorbike accident which he got cut very badly in the leg. On our tricycle ride to the emergency clinic, we had them stop at Buko so I could run and grab money. Stephanie at the front desk ran back up to the tricycle with me and came to help us get to the clinic and made sure the driver waited there to take us back once my husband was treated. She insisted on staying to make sure everything went okay. Once back at the resort, Stephanie, Esmeralda, and the rest of the staff wwent absolutely leaps and bounds beyond any care and hospitality we would have expected. I am honestly brought to tears thinking of how cared for we felt during such a scary experience.
Oh and we were here for my birthday as well and everyone made me feel so special when they found out!
I am so excited to come back to Buko (with some friends as well next time!) and I cannot reccomend this amazing resort enough. We have traveled quite a bit and can honestly say we have NEVER been treated as well as we were at Buko Beach Resort."

I loved having breakfast at their restaurant as the morning light and peaceful of the place is amazing.
The staff is super nice, very friendly and always looking forward to help you.
We rented a moto to travel around the island so the fact the hotel is not in the busy city center was a plus for us.

Disliked Â· There isnÂt anything that we didnÂt love about the place. For us is quiet hard to sleep with day light entering the room as the windows donÂt really have black outs, but I guess thatÂs the ÂpriceÂ you pay to be in the nature."

The Buko resort felt luxurious without losing the cultural authenticity of a Filipino beach town. From the bamboo rooms and furniture to the menu items. I really enjoyed have the best of both worlds during my stay here. My family loved starting our day at the restaurant with the spectacular view and great service. We also loved that the Buko team went above and beyond to celebrate my mom's birthday in addition to assisting us with our tours and adventures. P.S. go for the massages, they were amazing.

Disliked Â· My two minor suggestions for improvement would be to have a lock to the front door of the Grand Villa for safety reasons in general. The lighting in the living room was a bit too dim for night time so maybe adding a few more lamps would keep the lively atmosphere going. Other than that, it was an exceptional stay!"

The transfers from and to the airport were smooth, and very much appreciated! We also enjoyed the short orientation from one of the members of staff who came to greet us at the airport.
The room was beautiful with such a great view from the balcony. The balcony also has some really comfortable seats to lounge on (if youÂre so inclined).
The food at the restaurant was good! Would definitely recommend getting some traditional Filipino food if you can.
The hotel is also in a great area with some really nice bars and restaurants around!

Disliked Â· We did have a few issues with the water in our shower and sink (at times the water wasnÂt coming out at all, and at times it was coming out but was spitting up muck). Maintenance did the best they could to resolve the problem, but I think it was more to do with the storms that had come through than anything they could do.
We didnÂt swim in the ocean while we were there (the storm had made it pretty uninviting), but we were also told itÂs not entirely possible because of how shallow it is. The pool is perfectly fine if you want to take a dip. Just donÂt expect to be able to swim in the ocean during your stay. It does make for excellent stand up paddle boarding conditions though, apparently!"

We had some issues at check in, but they took care of it right away. We had fun in the pools, karaoke and kayak to the nearby beach for some private snorkeling. Some other reviews mention bad food, and we disagree strongly. We tried a lot of different food and everything was amazing. We usually asked for whatever the chef recommended that day.

Disliked Â· The resort is huge, but a big part of it seems abandoned."

Our beach villa was so comfortable and huge.

Disliked Â· The menu options for food were limited. If you stay longer than two days, you will most likely be eating the same things. And they were on the pricey side but that's expected for a luxury resort."

Firstly the food is well presented but we would like to see some fresh food on the menu. Maybe some fish or a bbq of the evening. Also sea was a little choppy one morning which bought in some plastic and rubbish. We would like to see the rubbish collected and recycled. Other than that an absolutely beautiful resort."

The amenities are lovely, thereÂs a bar near the sea/pier (bacauÂs own pier) where you can watch sunset. In the afternoon, they provide all the guests with cookies/simple delights with a card from the owner. Overall, it was a short but sweet and lovely stay. My partner and i had a wonderful time!

We had a unit with a deep bathtub and it was so nice to soak after a hot Philippines day. The decor is beautifully arranged, the pool is immaculate, the service is exceptional and the staff are so friendly and helpful even more than average Philippines. I can't give enough praise for this place. I will definitely return here if and when we visit Palawan.

Disliked Â· I thought the price for the bathtub was a little high but it doesn't take away from the experience."

Wonderful staff, particularly Girlie on reception who very kindly arranged for housekeeping & the restaurant to surprise my partner for his birthday!

The restaurant staff were very attentive & surprised my partner with a birthday cake & everyone in the restaurant sang Happy birthday!
Great location 10 minute walk from the centre!
Lovely rooftop pool with nice view!
One of the best breakfasts, weÂve had in 4 months of travelling through Asia staying just at hotels along the way (Shocked at the low scores as the buffet was super)
10-Oct

Disliked Â· 5000 deposit on arrival is a tiny bit excessive, but only a very small thing & wasnÂt a big issue as we loved El Nido & Lagun Hotel!"

The location is in between airport and city proper so just right. Whenever it gets rainy at night, you need not go elsewhere for dinner as their restaurant serves good food and also there is entertainment (a band or fire dance).
If you need to go to town proper, just request the reception for a tricycle and they will gladly call for you.
Their partner tour company, Bathala, took care of our two tours for 2 days and we super enjoyed it, even with a toddler (they were super caring and lovely with my daughter).

Disliked Â· They can get busy especially when there is a bit of crowd checking in or checking out so if you have a bit of things with you (ie multiple luggages), especially during check out, request in advance assistance to carry stuff to lobby. But if a staff sees you carrying luggage, guaranteed they will assist you."

The staff were really friendly and super helpful.
It was great to have a really nice bathroom and hot shower which we didn't always get in other locations in Phili.
The location is great too as it is close enough to the town but distant enough to feel secluded.

Disliked Â· The amount of bugs leading up to the room but that just comes with the location so it is not really the hotel's fault."

The tours also have access thru the beach so it was easier for us since we have an infant, a preschooler and 2 seniors. We also enjoyed the pool. The service was great. We arrived at 9:00am and they allowed us an early check in. Someone also assisted us with the check in the moment we arrived at the lobby. Our rooms are clean and can easily access the garden and pool area.

Disliked Â· NiknikÂ i have too many bites. iÂd like to suggest that citronella, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil
be provided for guests OR you can include in your infor guide when guests are coming maybe 1-2 days before they travel to Seda Lio."

So we came to Coron four days earlier than we planned. This was literally booked one day in advance. And we lucked out. What we loved especially was the hospitality! The staff was EXCEPTIONAL. Jen at the front desk was super lovely and helpful to us. This place is geared toward adults, but even our kids (15, 8) loved it here. They agree that the staff was wonderful! Everyday they gave complimentary snacks in the afternoon. And complimentary juices and fruit. Large refillable water bottles as well. Our kids got the ÂCubÂ room that can sleep three, overlooking the more shallow pool (with jacuzzi) My husband and I got the Mara room which is next to their deeper pool in a more quiet spot of the hotel. It was the best room, so relaxing. Good wifi!! Very clean. Rooftop bar with two jacuzzis! Saturdays they have a buffet dinner with a lovely band. We cannot say enough great things about this place."

We also loved the live music evening and made frequent trips to the spa for massages which were the best weÂve ever had.

Disliked Â· We really enjoyed the food at The Funny Lion but we didnÂt like the taste of the oil used for deep drying - it gave the fries a coconut flavour."

My wife and I stayed here for a week and couldnÂt get the entire week off work so we had a bit of a workcation and the first room we were in didnÂt have the best internet (the speeds were fine but not very stable) and they were kind enough to upgrade us to a villa and we had great internet/wifi connection the rest of our stay! So if you need to work during your stay, you should opt to pay for villa
The breakfast was included each morning and was a great buffet style that alternated each day and everything was pretty delicious. I enjoyed the coffee a lot which I think was a local brew. The roof top bar had great pizza and a beautiful view with two jacuzzis to relax in - the drinks were also fantastic and all the cocktails were tasty, and the bartender knew what I meant when I asked for less sweet, they delivered (no pun!) Speak of, room service from the restaurant was very good and I enjoyed the burger a lot.
Would definitely stay here again if/when weÂre back in Coron!

Disliked Â· Not many complaints - the wifi was challenging at first but the staff was so accommodating and wonderful to upgrade us to a villa to have a better connection. We did have to ask a few time for certain housekeeping requests - like our sheets changed rather than made over but very minor inconveniences in an overall wonderful stay."

They offered airport pickup and drop off 300 pesos each way which was a really good price and also convenient as it was our first time in Puerto Princesa/Palawan. The driver was easy to find in the airport arrivals area and he was very helpful and nice. When we got to the hotel, the reception staff were really friendly and told us all the information we needed, including letting us know about tourist activities like city tour packages, massages, island hopping etc. They also had a golf cart to help take us and our luggages to our rooms which was really helpful because the property was bigger than expected. The rooms were also very spacious and the shower room too. One of the best parts was definitely the nature and vibe of the hotel. The rooms were basically like mini cottages with your own outside seating area including a hammock which was my favourite part, we loved to use it every day and night to relax, drink, have a nice sit after dinner etc. The outdoor area was surrounded by the beautifully landscaped gardens; there were beautiful plants like bamboos, a massive overhanging tree, snake plants etc and it looked even more beautiful when it rained which it did a couple times during our stay. Another great part of the hotel was the restaurant. There was a lot of food on the menu, including delicious classic Filipino dishes but also pasta, sandwiches etc. They had amazing mango and calamansi smoothies, beer, and nicely made cocktails. The restaurant staff were nice&friendly also. We also booked a city tour package for 700pesos each which was a good price because we went to many sites around PP, including our favourite the Crocodile farm getting to see the massive crocs and holding a baby one too, the tour guide was also friendly and funny :) We also booked a massage and the masseuse came to our room which was convenient. Everything, from scenery to service, was excellent. Overall, an unforgettable experience.

Disliked Â· Not much to dislike, maybe just that the wifi voucher you're given is only allowed for one device so couldn't use it for my laptop but wasn't a big deal since I just used my personal hotspot on my phone whenever I needed it."

I appreciated the presence of a kitchen area and a proper refrigerator, which added convenience to my stay. Also, everything was in good shape (unfortunately, that is not so obvious here in the Philippines). The location is good, close to the airport and there are many day trips that will pick you up. Overall, it was a positive experience, and I would recommend it.

Disliked Â· I didn't like that there were many, many mosquitoes. So come prepared and bring a repellant!"

ItÂs within easy walking distance of the centre and restaurants, and convenient for island hopping or diving trips. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The reception staff are just wonderful, and make the visit very pleasant. I rebooked there on my return to Coron from el nido a few days later.

Disliked Â· ItÂs a bit of an art (which I didnÂt fully master) getting the shower temperature right."

The team always seems to aim (and achieve) to go above and beyond by taking their time to learn about your plans and finding ways to assist. We casually told of our plans to take a ferry to El Nido upon check-out and the next morning we were informed that transport to the ferry would be ready. We did not even tell them at what time we would leave but they planned it spot-on. The ladies truly know how to anticipate the needs of their guests. The service at the bar/restaurant is good, especially combined with the meals and drinks they deliver.
Our favorite hotel on one of the most beautiful islands we have seen on our travels."

The bed is super comfortable, the whole room is very clean and very spacious.
Breakfast is a buffet, but it's always the same every day.
A good place if you are looking for a quiet place and take the family

Disliked Â· The only downside is that it is far from the center, but taking a tricycle from the door takes you to the center in a few minutes and is not expensive."

Disliked Â· Room tiles is slippery and it is not good for infants or toddlers who like to run around. Sometimes it moisten maybe because of the aircon temperature so we need to lower it to avoid our kids to get slipped. Another is the waiters/waitress at the restaurant during breakfast were not alert enough to welcome and assist the guest. You need to request them to place the utensils on the table first before they prepare it for you."

That they claim it was the room we booked while its very clear on booking that this was not the case. It was a lower price overflow room for those who dont specify anything.. that it took them one night to fix the problem.no point blaming the systems as the systems need to be configured by someone, to ensure right category room show up on both booking.com and other similar sites.

There was a live band on Friday or Saturday night and I initially thought it was a hotel guest with an unpleasant voice hogging the karaoke for hours."

Place is kid friendly and safe.

Disliked Â· Lots of items on the menu ran out and werenÂt replaced during our time there.
Live entertainment at night is hidden in an area where no knows itÂs going on or canÂt enjoy it.
No ATM at hotel and stores not walking distance.
Only one restaurant to choose from but food was pretty good.
The resort still needs to work out some kinks but is going to be beautiful and people will like it once itÂs all complete."

They all deserve salary raise from the hotel management sitting comfortably in Manila. Location is nice and how we wish the management will do more to preserve the Mangrove forests there and not to put up expensive Water Villas on it. Please get rid of the garbage near the Water Villas. The pool is lovely. Kudos to the guy cleaning on the pool. Love the shower because of the great water pressure.

Disliked Â· Our room smells moldy and one can see molds in the bathroom. Very expensive for a soft-opening! Breakfast is not at all a 5 star hotel level. The hotel staffs cannot do anything about it. They can only prepare what the management will provide for them. Notbmuch space to put/hang clothes. For the late cleaning of rooms, I am not complaining. I only pity these guys who are the only ones cleaning the whole hotel rooms. They deserve all the tips they got from us everyday. No ironing board and other basics. 5 star hotel? Definitely not."

Food in restaurant was good, however, timing of food service was poor, for example two of us ordered dinner. Hers was served in :15 minutes, mine was served in :30 minutes. Cooks must be able to time their cooking so that all meals are completed and served at the same time. Cooks did not know how to cook eggs over easy. Most of the amenities did not seem available as it was under renovation. This was not disclosed during booking."

I think that a major discount should have been given for the inconveniences, which by the way will last for all of 2023."

Disliked Â· slight construction noise from the new tower they are building, but it wasn't really a problem. The breakfast buffet is marginal in availability, variety.and slow service staff, but again, this is a soft opening, so be patient."

Disliked Â· My flight with airswift was cancelled because of maintenance repair . If the plane prior to us had to make an emergency landing cuz the propeller busted and was not working , I think there was warrant for airswift to do maintentence repair with all the planes . In saying this we werenÂt able to go to coron because all flights were grounded for 5 days. I had payed already for the panoramic suite the day our flight was cancelled hence we missed one night stay . Despite airswift giving us a certificate of cancellation and providing receipts we had payed for our night stay , the hotel refused to give a refund which was totally disappointing and disgusting cuz it was not our fault . You would thing they would be understanding and give refund Â I was wrong. I totally enjoyed our only night stay the day we were able to get to stay which was the next day . Hotel is very nice but because of this experience I will not stay there again . WeÂve booked in hotels with no problems of refunds when flights were cancelled . It was a very frustrating event ."

We checked out around 5am, and we were able to leave with hot breakfast, which helped a lot.

Disliked Â· The only thing we didnÂt like was that we missed checking in the first night we were supposed to be there, due to a delayed flight. We booked three nights and only stayed for two nights. The manager asked us to provide proof of the delayed flight, which we ended up emailing to her before we checked out, but the manager never bothered replying or acknowledging our email."

The amenities were great, including the pool. The gym was sufficient for my purposes (just free weights, a treadmill, maybe another cardio machine). The a la carte food and drink was decent and not too overly priced for a hotel of this caliber.
The staff was also very professional and polite. They remembered my name throughout my short 2-night stay, and were always very helpful.

Disliked Â· I know this isn't entirely on them, but they are associated. The private tour I got through the hotel (which is great that you can charge to your room btw) was on time to pick me up from the hotel, but then we sat on the boat and waited for over 45min, close to an hour on the boat itself in the harbor just waiting for the tour guide. It's just not something that I would expect when you knowingly pay an upcharge by booking through the hotel. It was about 200 dollars for an ""8 hour island escapade tour"" that had me sitting on a boat in the harbor waiting for the guide for almost 1 of those 8 hours.
Location is also not too central, though it's only about a 20min walk into town. You'd think it would be more quiet but there was a bar nearby that you could hear at night.
Lastly, the included breakfast was subpar for what I would expect from this caliber of hotel. Certainly acceptable, but just did not have many traditional options. Though I tend to try to eat traditional food on my travels - they did have waffles, pancakes, and an omelet station so if you eat mostly western, you should be fine."

Non-smoking rooms",706,Adiel, Israel,"Liked Â· The staff was great and so welcoming. Breakfast had all the necessary ingredients and they cooked eggs and pancakes by request.
The pool was so beautiful and the temperature of the water was just perfect for a hot and sunny day. Location was great as well, close to everywhere by tuktuk and there was a massage place and a convenient store right in front of the hotel. The room was specious and overall clean.
Beds were comfortable and large. And a special thanks to Adam the bartender who made us feel so welcome with a great service and smile.

Disliked Â· They were ants everywhere in the room even though we did not leave any food laying around. The sink faucet slashed everywhere each time we opened it. And the water in the toilet sometimes would not go down the drain.
TV in the room are smart TV but not connected to internet so you can only watch cable TV.
There was no plug for the electric kettle and the cable was so short we had to plug it on the floor behind the TV table."

The breakfast options were a mix between Asian food and western food. There was also a band and singer that entertained guests during the evenings.

Disliked Â· The location could've been a bit more central. The fitness centre was quite small and stuffy. Some of the equipment there needed to be fixed or maintained a bit better. Breakfast food options were a bit limited."

Our stay would have not been complete without doing the daily excursions which was only possible with the professional help of reservation agent Jessica, from the time I booked to the time we arrived she had organized exactly what we needed to have a great experience and she exceeded that.

Disliked Â· The smell of mold is what really needs to be taken care of as this could be a health hazard for present and future guests."
