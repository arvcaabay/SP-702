1,Tag Resort,Serge, Democratic Republic of the Congo,"Liked · The staffs were extremely kind, they arranged for our tours as well as city visit. The swimming pool was breathtaking as well as the food and drinks!
The place deserves more light on this platform as we came across it by luck, yet it is really gorgeous."

3,Tag Resort,Santa, Norway,"Liked · Food, location, staff, rooms and area was really,really nice!"
4,Tag Resort,Claudine, United Kingdom,"Liked · The aesthetic and design of the entire resort was lovely and comfortable, specially the swimming pool. The standard double room was decent enough for 4 people. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful and professional. Great TAG cocktails, and there's a Starbucks café! What more could you ask for?

Disliked · The dishes at the restaurant need some improvement, but the breakfast is good enough. The doors of the rooms could do with some additional barriers/excluders against bugs."

Disliked · Maybe add a gym?"
11,Tag Resort,Alma, Philippines,"Liked · The rooms were good

Disliked · Rooms are great! We stayed on the villa with pool access. But considering their 4star, Customer service is not great, staff are not very friendly and welcoming specially at the reception/front desk. Been raining the whole time we were there, and requested for umbrella as its a sprawling villa style resort but never received one. Service not so great, breakfast is basically just the same everyday. Kinda a downwr if tour staying more than days- we stayed for 4 days…"
12,Tag Resort,Burgess, Bermuda,Liked · Every thing
13,Tag Resort,Bruno, France,"Liked · Very nice facilities, beautiful pools and surrounding accommodations. Large rooms (Tadhana), very comfortable. Good breakfast full of choices and the resort is very close to Coron town."
14,Tag Resort,Mihály, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · Our stay at this hotel was truly enjoyable. The view provided was stunning, and the hotel's location outside the city ensured a peaceful and quiet environment. The overall atmosphere was both awesome and relaxing, making us feel as if we were in a paradise-like setting. Additionally, the staff members were extremely friendly and helpful, further enhancing our experience. It was a wonderful stay overall."
15,Tag Resort,Mohammed, Saudi Arabia,Liked · everything and all of the staff:)
16,Tag Resort,Malou, Netherlands,"Liked · room and pool

Disliked · music in the dining was a bit loud"
17,Tag Resort,Alyssa, Canada,"Liked · Location, value for money and the excellent service from the staff

Disliked · a bit overpriced food and drinks but the signature drinks are really good!"
18,Tag Resort,Krencelou, Australia,"Liked · Wonderful staff (really kind and helpful), beautiful place (loving their pool area and room is clean and looks new). The location is in between airport and city proper so just right. Whenever it gets rainy at night, you need not go elsewhere for dinner as their restaurant serves good food and also there is entertainment (a band or fire dance).
If you need to go to town proper, just request the reception for a tricycle and they will gladly call for you.
Their partner tour company, Bathala, took care of our two tours for 2 days and we super enjoyed it, even with a toddler (they were super caring and lovely with my daughter).

Disliked · They can get busy especially when there is a bit of crowd checking in or checking out so if you have a bit of things with you (ie multiple luggages), especially during check out, request in advance assistance to carry stuff to lobby. But if a staff sees you carrying luggage, guaranteed they will assist you."
19,Tag Resort,Vishal, United Kingdom,"Liked · Really nice room and facilities.
The staff were really friendly and super helpful.
It was great to have a really nice bathroom and hot shower which we didn't always get in other locations in Phili.
The location is great too as it is close enough to the town but distant enough to feel secluded.

Disliked · The amount of bugs leading up to the room but that just comes with the location so it is not really the hotel's fault."
20,Tag Resort,Aileen, Australia,"Liked · Tha ambience and staff. The room, everything."
