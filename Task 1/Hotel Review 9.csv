1,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Piotr, United States of America,"Liked · Everything place ,staff,food, only ifs far from city"
2,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Diego, Chile,"Liked · The staff is absolutely the most warm and welcoming we have ever experienced. They were up to everything to make our vacation the best.
The resort is right in front of the beach, has a great pool, massage parlor and many free and paid activities available
Restaurant, while a little expensive, was delicious!
Disliked · I think the WiFi could be a little better, it is way too slow
The rooms are very nice, with a cottage vibe. The bathrooms could be renovated tho. They are not bad, but they’re borderline."
3,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Ahmed, Saudi Arabia,"Liked · The location is beautiful. The view is amazing the beach is wonderful and the Ghawi boys are amazing ?. Specially, Joyce ,Abigail , Tricia, ?and ?Jimmy ? thank you all."
4,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Matt, United Kingdom,"Liked · -amazing remote location
-beautiful beach- best on Palawan in our opinion!

5,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Samik, Japan,Liked · Access to beach and privacy was excellent
6,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Daria, Philippines,"Liked · Amazing location. Hospitable staff.

Disliked · On a second day of my stay I got strange bug’s bite. it was extremely itchy and I have red marks from these bites for 2 weeks already.
maybe hotel could provide some lotion to protects from it"
7,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Mustafa, United Kingdom,"Liked · Positive and negative reviews...the staff were always polite, friendly and went above and beyond when my son was sick.
The beach was clean. Water clear. Around 10 minute walk to shops at the boat port. No other local restaurants nearby.
We had a massage by  which was amazing.

Disliked · The food was quite limited, we stayed there for a week. There was no kids menu, and we had to request for them to make some things so my child could have varied meals."
8,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Harriz, United Kingdom,"Liked · Could not be happier with our stay here. Sheer luxury with attentive staff, huge comfy bed in a clean and spacious room. Incredible view from the balcony. Beach all to ourselves, cocktails whilst swimming in the pool, delicious food, free breakfast, a wonderfully romantic getaway resort and I can't wait to return. There's a town nearby with shops and food options as well as boats to the underground river. Very happy with our stay.

Disliked · The WiFi connection was unreliable and the TV wasn't connected to the internet but we weren't there to watch TV so not a big problem for us. If ordering room service you may have a few furry dog friends hanging around but if you like animals this isn't a problem they're just cute and hungry."
9,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,David, United Kingdom,"Liked · Room and beach view

Disliked · Staff's misleading information regarding the commute with main cities of the island . They tried to convince us that the is no local commute so we pay extra for their privet transfers."
10,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Damhnaic, United Kingdom,Liked · A perfect location with all the facilities one could ask for. The villas were stunning and the restaurant food excellent along with the great staff.
11,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Mario, United States of America,"Liked · Great destination, staff superb, clean facilities, location next to underground river and zip line, just a wonderful experience. The resort has a small number of cottages which make it perfect, not overcrowded. The landscape all around is artistically designed and well manicured. Security 24/7. Have I mentioned the staff was superb? No hidden fees, my bill was correct down to the peso.

Disliked · A minor dislike, but not a reason for not coming back, was that the sea is ten steps away and no fish (seafood)on the menu. The restaurant should have been heavy on grilled fish(es), shrimp, calamari, squid, etc."
12,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Grachelle, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · 1. Arriving a bit late from 2 consecutive flights and 2 hour land travel, our patience is running low. Staff for some reason put us on an upper floor when all the while I believe we were booked on the ground floor because of my 2 active children. Had to insist on my preferred location and Abby and Jake patiently accommodated our request, even showing us possible options. its been a beautiful customer experience especially for a travelling family.
Thank you Jake from housekeeping and Abby from reception, you've been amazing.
2. the unit facing the beach itself is paradise. waking up in the morning just few steps away from the beach with a well manicured garden...fabulous! (its petty, but the tap in front of each unit is superb, for a person with OCD, this little detail to keep the room tidy is spot on!.)
3. the unit itself (we stayed in 801 - beach villa B. the difference between A, B and C if i am not mistaken is having a powder room or just a simple bathroom..i think....but we were in B and thats been lovely) the room was spacious enough.
4. Location is perfect - we simply walk along the beach to the little center where few restaurants and little shops are.
5. its close to the subterranean river and zipline site... No need to get package or tour - simply go to the tourism office and pay for the trip yourself, boats are there too. for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) we only spent less than 3000 pesos for the trip to the underground river and 550 for each for the zipline.
6. breakfast is well presented with attentive but not intrusive staff - Edmond and team, thank you for the beautiful experience. (my kids loved their eggs benedict!)
7. food is also good with reasonable price as well. They have an amazing chef presenting Filipino dishes quite well (they have other options too).
8. i love it that its independent and not a hotel chain so you are kind of supporting smaller businesses but it is with a 5 star quality.

Disliked · its not hotels fault but just the presence of this insect called Nik-nik, like little blood suckers, am still healing from the bites after 3 weeks. they dont get turned off by mosquito repellants but we were told ""Off lotion"" is more useful.
so appreciate Ivan for giving us his cream... thats customer service on an extra mile..."
13,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Ken, United States of America,"Liked · Just a really nice place. We went there in the off-season so there was hardly anyone there. We had the whole place to ourselves and it was great

Disliked · The restaurant was great, and the food was excellent, however, the wine list was nonexistent. Apparently, somebody in charge believes that the only way to sell wine is by the entire bottle. This is a mistake, and one that I asked that they correct, but they seemed to care less. We were offered a choice of red, white, and rosé. Each of these wines came from a nondescript winery in Spain. I was able to get a sample of the red wine and it was terrible. I recommend the staff spend just a small amount of time and acquire some wines from other places and the world, and that they pay attention to the fact that wine IS food, and it should be offered and paired with food appropriately. Ignoring this fact is unwise, but that is exactly what this resort has done and continues to do. Please fix this at once, then let me know and perhaps I'll return for another visit."
14,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Andrew, Italy,"Disliked · The room had a lot of large bugs that made their way inside multiple places in the room (bathroom, shower area, and bed). Other than that, everything was perfect!"
15,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,, United Arab Emirates,"Liked · Property is fine location is quite and safe

Disliked · So many kind of insect, we knows that environment nature, only advised to maybe need to provide insecticide spray each room"
16,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Vernon, United States of America,"Liked · The facilities were five-star. Beautiful swimming pool with swim up bar. The restaurant was first class with amazing food and incredible service. The Wi-Fi worked excellent in the rooms, the beach was large and clean with beautiful warm water. It was a little on the expensive side, but we enjoyed our stay.

Disliked · This property is very very far from any activities except the underground river. If you want to sit on a beautiful white sand beach and enjoy relaxation this is a place for you. If you want other restaurants, bars or activities, then I would not recommend this location. ?"
17,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Jolita, Lithuania,Liked · Nice place with beautiful beach. Friendly and helpful stuff.
18,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Jillian, United States of America,"Liked · The food was fantastic, very high quality restaurant dining. The staff was very warm and helpful, from booking tours to laundry and other guest services. We felt very taken care of on our stay and we’re able to relax and spend quality family time.
The beach view is unbeatable and it was great to get away from the city for a few days and look out at the water."
19,Daluyon Beach and Mountain Resort,Jacques, France,"Liked · nice location in front of a long sand beach
