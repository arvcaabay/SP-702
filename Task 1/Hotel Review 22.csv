1,Coron Westown Resort,Jesse, Canada,"Liked  Room was great, people and service were great.

Disliked  Wifi was touch and go in the hotel room but worked everywhere else"
2,Coron Westown Resort,Shae, United States of America,Liked  The location was ideal!
3,Coron Westown Resort,Jazon, United States of America,"Liked  Nice facility, clean rooms and friendly accommodating staff.

Disliked  During our stay, there wasn't a hot water for shower and bath. They told us there was a water main break on the facility."
4,Coron Westown Resort,Fenchie, Philippines,"Liked  It is located away from the busy town which is a great plus. There were 3 pools and are very kid friendly. Also the rooms were spacious although we would have loved to get the family as what we initially planned but turned out unavailable when we got there. The staff were great to just give us two deluxe rooms without additional charges.

Disliked  There뭩 a stinking smell around the pool area, i think it뭩 from the toilets exhaust, the one below the pool. Also the room floor is kind of slippery, i wish there was complimentary slippers for the room."
5,Coron Westown Resort,Margaret, Philippines,Liked  the rooms are beautiful and the food is good.
6,Coron Westown Resort,Jmbrosa, Portugal,"Liked  The architecture of the hotel is very beautiful, we stayed in a room with a Kings bed and the view was phenomenal (sea view) from the balcony. The resort has several pools if you want to take a dip after the tours or walks.
The bed is super comfortable, the whole room is very clean and very spacious.
Breakfast is a buffet, but it's always the same every day.
A good place if you are looking for a quiet place and take the family

Disliked  The only downside is that it is far from the center, but taking a tricycle from the door takes you to the center in a few minutes and is not expensive."
7,Coron Westown Resort,Maningo, Philippines,"Liked  The resort already have everything that you want especially if you don뭪 like to stroll around the town. They have live band every night where you can chill on or a pool where you want relax at. They have also this welcoming cockatoo that greet and entertain us always while waiting for our service. Room make up is excellent same as with the front desk who always take care of our needs as well as the concierge and bell boys who are very accommodating to assist.

Disliked  Room tiles is slippery and it is not good for infants or toddlers who like to run around. Sometimes it moisten maybe because of the aircon temperature so we need to lower it to avoid our kids to get slipped. Another is the waiters/waitress at the restaurant during breakfast were not alert enough to welcome and assist the guest. You need to request them to place the utensils on the table first before they prepare it for you."

12,Coron Westown Resort,, United Kingdom,"Liked  Good size rooms, massive shower, 4 pools which were amazing, free towels at the pool given too, they offer free filtered water and bring it to the room any time of day. Would stay again

Disliked  Bit out of the way from town but you can get a tricycle easily from the staff at the front (and didn't get ripped off). Food was overpriced and small portions. Couldn't pay on card unless over a certain amount. No ice in the day for drinks so no cocktails."

Disliked  bit far from the main town"
14,Coron Westown Resort,Sarah, Australia,"Liked  Good value for money. Generous sized, clean rooms and bathrooms. Large clean pool.

Disliked  The restaurant and breakfast buffet is not great. It is worth taking a tricycle into town for meals. Our favourite place to eat was Le Voyage."
15,Coron Westown Resort,Matsglobetrotter, Italy," Liked  Loved the pool.and the room once we got the room we booked as per booking .com. very friendly staff. Excellent mango shakes:-) lovely music in the evenings

Disliked  That they put us in a side room that does not even show on any pictures with so limited view its.. not as per advetized. That they claim it was the room we booked while its very clear on booking that this was not the case. It was a lower price overflow room for those who dont specify anything.. that it took them one night to fix the problem.no point blaming the systems as the systems need to be configured by someone, to ensure right category room show up on both booking.com and other similar sites.
Breakfast place need a better solution for the gazzillion flies we were met with."
16,Coron Westown Resort,Holly, Australia,"Liked  the resort was so welcoming and in such a good location

20,Coron Westown Resort,Ricarte, United Kingdom,"Liked  Room had an amazing view of rhe mountains and sea. Room was cleaned daily. Check in and check iut was quick.

Disliked  Gym was not airconditioned and was facing west so it was like hell using the treadmill in the afternoon. There were only 4 equipment there and 2 were under maintenance.
Ordered room service: sinigang na isda... the soup tasted good but the fish was so tasteless. Calamares also did not tasted terrible.
There was a live band on Friday or Saturday night and I initially thought it was a hotel guest with an unpleasant voice hogging the karaoke for hours."
