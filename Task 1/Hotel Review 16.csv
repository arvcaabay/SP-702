1,Lagun Hotel,Maria, United Kingdom,"Liked  Exceptional stay!
Wonderful staff, particularly Girlie on reception who very kindly arranged for housekeeping & the restaurant to surprise my partner for his birthday!
The towel display on arrival for our anniversary was amazing & the following day for my partners birthday was incredible!
The restaurant staff were very attentive & surprised my partner with a birthday cake & everyone in the restaurant sang Happy birthday!
Great location 10 minute walk from the centre!
Lovely rooftop pool with nice view!
One of the best breakfasts, we뭭e had in 4 months of travelling through Asia staying just at hotels along the way (Shocked at the low scores as the buffet was super)
10-Oct

Disliked  5000 deposit on arrival is a tiny bit excessive, but only a very small thing & wasn뭪 a big issue as we loved El Nido & Lagun Hotel!"
2,Lagun Hotel,Brian, Australia,"Liked  Location was good, staff were very friendly and pool was great.

Disliked  Breakfast would be my only complaint. Not much variety."
3,Lagun Hotel,Zec, France,"Liked  gr羽t location - less than 10 min walk to the city of El Nido in an area relatively calm - spectacular view of the cliff from the premium rooms and from the rooftop pool

Disliked  maybe a little too much music from the bar across the street but the windows are well
insulated"
4,Lagun Hotel,Gabbie, United Kingdom,"Liked  Amazing hospitality from the staff, very grateful for the warm welcome and for the level of service throughout my family뭩 4-night stay."
5,Lagun Hotel,Georgie, United Kingdom,"Liked  the pool was great, amazing location walking distance to everything. staff were super helpful with everything. the rooms were clean, pretty basic but have smart tv and kettle. great value for money especially location wise

Disliked  the WiFi was super bad but there was power outs and the hotel was running on generators so that can be forgiven.
our dry cleaning wasn뭪 great
there was a bad smell coming from the drains"
6,Lagun Hotel,Vicky, Australia,"Liked  the staff were warm friendly caring and made us feel welcome and looked after very well. The room was comfy and very clean.

Disliked  the bathroom was a little small but still very functional.
The food orders took a very long time to come, and many advertised meals on the menu were not available."
7,Lagun Hotel,Elizabeth, Philippines,"Liked  Ms.Bambi, the hotel manager, was very corteous and her kindness was overwhelming. I will definitely go back to this hotel. The staff were accomodating 24/7, our room was always cleaned after our tours, and the breakfast was amazing. I just hope they have more filipino food for breakfast like corned beef, hotdogs. I think they prioritized catering to international cuisines since majority of the guests were foreigners."
8,Lagun Hotel,, Australia,"Liked  Lovely staff, comfy bed, good breakfast, walking distance to town but far enough from the hustle and bustle.

Disliked  There was an constant banging noise coming from upstairs somewhere that went all day and all night keeping us awake for the first few days. No idea what it was but it was much more peaceful once it finally stopped!"
9,Lagun Hotel,Ronald, United States of America,"Liked  interior decor, location, friendly Staff, cleanliness

Disliked  food selection"
10,Lagun Hotel,Kristine, Philippines,"Liked  the location is perfect. just walking distance from the busy center but perfect for relaxing and quiet area. The property is very modern. The lobby is really cozy compared to other similar sized hotels. The interiors are very modern and instagramable! It is clean and the staff are all so friendly and accommodating. i highly recommend this hotel.

Disliked  they should add more lights around the pool at night, since the pool itself has no underwater lights."
11,Lagun Hotel,Julie, Hong Kong,Liked  All excellent
12,Lagun Hotel,Julie, Hong Kong,"Liked  very clear, super service, staff nice, breakfast good, we will definitely come back staff in this hotel"
13,Lagun Hotel,Amir, Israel,Liked  We realy enjoyed an excellent breakfast. The best fluffy omlet in town. The staff was very helpfull and warm.
14,Lagun Hotel,Hector, United States of America,Liked  Everything friendly staff & foods
15,Lagun Hotel,Milan, United States of America,"Liked  loved the pool, breakfast daily, location in regards to the things we visited on the island, and how they assisted with a lot of additional things (like airport transfer, day trip to another part of island)

Disliked  wish there was a view of the water, the deposit when checking in isn뭪 so pricey."
16,Lagun Hotel,Fearghal, Ireland,"Liked  Lovely view from pool, nice staff and rooms.

Disliked  Breakfast not great and wakened by roosters all night (not hotels fault)!"
17,Lagun Hotel,Nico, Philippines,"Liked  location and staff

Disliked  slow internet with the limitation of access"
18,Lagun Hotel,Vanessa, Qatar,"Liked  Close to town for shops and restaurants, but not close enough to hear all the noise. The beds were very comfortable too.

Disliked  The breakfast doesn't really cater for vegetarians and there wasn't enough fruit."
19,Lagun Hotel,Kai, China,"Liked  The breakfast was decent and fresh. Staff are nice and welcoming. They helped us booked TourABCD with a pretty good deal.

Disliked  We got food poisoned from the Hotel restaurant because of the green beans which were not cooked well. The hotel did not give us the refund because they said we have no proof and manager was on leave."
20,Lagun Hotel,Ana, Germany,"Liked  the location was perfect, the room was spacious, the staff was always friendly, they made extra effort to serve us granola and soy milk for breakfast (since we're vegan), loved the pool

Disliked  it's noisy at night, only 2 fruits for one week at the breakfast buffet (if you're vegan it tends to get boring), the housekeeping forgot 90% of our stay to provide us with fresh towels, or toilet paper or to fill up our shower gel dispenser."
