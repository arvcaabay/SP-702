Disliked · there’s nothing I can really complain about, we’re on a remote island, but we did not get hot water in the shower. which was probably for the best given my sunburn!"

5,Frangipani El Nido,Yi, Hong Kong,"Liked · amazing location on the quiet part of the beach, not as commercial and noisy as at El Nido town, perfect spot for us as an escape from the city. amazing sunset spot as well, we spent 3 days at the hotel to watch sunset, just can’t get enough of it

Disliked · the only thing I can whine about is the hot water at night, as it uses solar panel, the water just can’t get hot enough when at night"
6,Frangipani El Nido,Cuviello, United States of America,"Liked · The staff were incredibly hospitable. The location is perfect with insane sunset views and the food was amazing. We would do it all over again!

7,Frangipani El Nido,Haci, Sweden,"Liked · We stayed for three nights and loved it. The view is amazing, the crew is really nice and helpful. it’s close to activities and El Nido town, but you get the tranquility you want away from town. Really nothing to complain about, it’s definitely a must book and stay at least two nights.

Disliked · Honestly nothing to complain about. Everything was top and you do really feel you are at an exclusive place.
Just a few small things to improve:
- The dinner menu can be improved and extended, but the springrolls are insanely good, best I’ve had. A must try."

11,Frangipani El Nido,Sadha, Maldives,"Liked · We had a great time and the hotel was beautiful and the views were breathtaking.
The breakfast was awesome as well. The buffet had a variety of everything that would be perfect for your taste to eat in the morning.
The location was right next to the beach, yet the rooms were noise free and calm. It was really relaxing both inside and outside of the hotel.
The hotel and the rooms were well decorated and very clean. A very well managed property i must say.
They also arranged our transfer to the next hotel and they staffs were amazing and friendly. Over all, it was an amazing experience."

I think my wife fell in love with me all over again."
14,Frangipani El Nido,Catherine, United States of America,"Liked · Frangipani is thoughtfully designed to be secluded and relaxing. Chin was super helpful with paperwork and guidance while on the island. Jenn, the accountant, was really nice and helpful. The food at the restaurant was a treat. Such good and fresh Filipino food. They also accommodated us with veggie kare kare. The wine selection was also delicious and well priced. We loved our stay and will be back!"
15,Frangipani El Nido,Veneranda, Philippines,Disliked · Enjoyed the food on the menu. Ate most of our meals in their restaurant. Good selection.
16,Frangipani El Nido,Jade, Malaysia,"Liked · The staff were so friendly and helpful at every step! The welcome drink and farewell sandwich was a particularly nice touch.
The transfers from and to the airport were smooth, and very much appreciated! We also enjoyed the short orientation from one of the members of staff who came to greet us at the airport.
The room was beautiful with such a great view from the balcony. The balcony also has some really comfortable seats to lounge on (if you’re so inclined).
The food at the restaurant was good! Would definitely recommend getting some traditional Filipino food if you can.
The hotel is also in a great area with some really nice bars and restaurants around!

Disliked · We did have a few issues with the water in our shower and sink (at times the water wasn’t coming out at all, and at times it was coming out but was spitting up muck). Maintenance did the best they could to resolve the problem, but I think it was more to do with the storms that had come through than anything they could do.
We didn’t swim in the ocean while we were there (the storm had made it pretty uninviting), but we were also told it’s not entirely possible because of how shallow it is. The pool is perfectly fine if you want to take a dip. Just don’t expect to be able to swim in the ocean during your stay. It does make for excellent stand up paddle boarding conditions though, apparently!"
17,Frangipani El Nido,James, United Kingdom,"
Liked · Staff were exemplary.
Room 202 which we had for most of the stay was perfect.Disliked ·
Disliked . Not the hotels problem but the beach was very dirty most days.
Room 103 had some issues with plumbing and the WiFi reception wasn't great, kept dropping out. Also no view out the window."
18,Frangipani El Nido,Derek, Hong Kong,"Liked · - tailored services and commutes/shuttles taken care of
- exclusive given there are only 7 rooms available
Disliked · - Breakfast can have more ample options to allow extra food amount or coffee, currently it is a defined set"
19,Frangipani El Nido,Maria, Germany,"Liked · - Boutique style Hotel
Disliked · - Very minor: Pool is very small. We did not use it"
20,Frangipani El Nido,Neza, Switzerland,"Liked · It is a very beautiful hotel with a great interior design and a beautiful view. It is close to the city with an amazing view of the islands and also the sunset. The staff was really nice, helpful, always there for us.

Disliked · I never understood why are there no sunbeds. The hotel has a small pool, but it is really small one and no sunbeds, so spending there the whole day would be a little challanging since you have no place to go … the beach is nearby, but nobody is actually (also other people, not just hotel guests) is staying on it."
