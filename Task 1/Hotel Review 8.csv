1,LIHIM RESORTS,Jessica, United Arab Emirates,"Liked  The resort is stunning and completely tucked away, yet only minutes from El Nido by speedboat. We had gorgeous views of the bay from our room, and ate the majority of our meals on the balcony because it was such a great setup. (Definitely eat as many Breakfasts in the room as possible!).
We had a villa with a pool, and I'd definitely recommend that type of room. The rooftop pool at Henri's was great as well, and the perfect place to watch sunset (make sure to go up for cocktails too). We ate dinner on the terrace to enjoy the fresh air, but the inside restaurant looked great as well.
The facilities were great - gorgeous pool that gets full sun at the entrance and main restaurant, and a decent gym and great spa - make sure to get a massage!
It's the people that really made it though, Claudia and Faith went above and beyond to make our stay memorable, from organizing our breakfasts, to customizing a private island hopping day, they did it all. We went out twice with Rio and Mark on the speedboat and had the best time - island hopping is a must, it's so stunning. Make sure to have lunch at their private lagoon (Cadlao lagoon) as well."

8,LIHIM RESORTS,Charlie, Australia,"Liked  Everything about this hotel is excellent! We spent our anniversary here and we were not disappointed. You get VIP treatment from the moment you step in El Nido, from their free airport transfer, warm welcome and very accomodating butlers. The hotel is aptly named because you feel like you're in a secret place where there is privacy and surrounded by nature.
I also enjoyed every food I had from their restaurant. Kudos to the kitchen staff and chef!
I was hesitant to book here at first because there were only a few reviews, but I found out later on that the resort was fairly new.

Disliked  The only thing I didn't like was the inaccessibility to the main town. You have to book a multicab or speed boat to leave the property. Although the process was easy and they were able to accommodate our request easily, I just wish there were other options."
9,LIHIM RESORTS,Michael, United States of America,"Liked  Amazing location. The best staff. Premium villa was the nicest room I've ever stayed in, and the staff made so many nice touches to our stay. It's no wonder this place is one of the best luxury boutique hotels in Asia. Sedrick (spelling) is an amazing tour guide as well. Every other person on a public or private tour was jealous of our guide for good reason.

Disliked  Currently only one choice for restaurant, but they are adding a second restaurant soon. It's not the most walkable resort due to the elevation, but the staff more than makes up for it by shuttling you where you need to go"
10,LIHIM RESORTS,Moore, Germany,"Liked  We were blown away by the resort and our butler, Faith. They went above and beyond by accommodating our very restrictive dietary requirements, making our experience seamless with early check in and late checkout, and planned memorable excursions the could be enjoyed by adults and my three year old (as well as a surprise birthday dinner). They have impressive attention to details that really make a family vacation - my daughter loved the pool toys. The two resident dogs, Warrior and Panda, also made our trip one to remember. We can뭪 wait to come back."
11,LIHIM RESORTS,Florence, Philippines,"Liked  Attentive staff , green resort, relaxing , room was clean and spacious , food was great!"
12,LIHIM RESORTS,Seohee, South Korea,"Liked  This is one of the BEST PLACE that i've visited in mylife as life traveler.
Location: This hotel is located in very private island and bring you the most peaceful but vibrant place for your holiday.
Service: From the beginning of the journey, butlers are greeting us from the airport and care never ends even after I leave the places. Butlers and staffs are extremely friendly, taking care of you every place you are visiting and very thoughtful service - (the best was, when we got back from swimming/kayaking, they brought us cold tower to fresh us up!
Food: Henri's has the BEST VIEW from daytime till the evening. Sunset is the best from the top of the island and the food is really well organized and served with good quality.
Drinks: they do have lots of great options from cocktails, whiskey, wines. I loved the Mosco mule from the pool the most.
Facilities: Gym, Sauna, Pool (two places) and Tour service everything was over the expectation.
Staff: I've been to lots of 5star hotels and private resorts. staffs in Lihim was the BEST. I see their service is from their heart."
13,LIHIM RESORTS,Glynn, United States of America,Liked  the property and food was excellent but the best part of the stay was the staff. My butlers Anna and Elle helped me take this time to another level FANTASTIC JOB!!!!

19,LIHIM RESORTS,Sumantra, United Arab Emirates,"Liked  the rooms are nice, esp the bathroom

Disliked  there was no water on 2 entires evenings from around 4 pm to 2am꿵urs was a 3 day stay. there was no internet for a whole day, supposedly some network was down in el nido. water activities not possible because of coast guard warning, no beach nearby and the ones 30 mins away are crowded and public꿻he food esp breakfast was pathetic for a 5 star hotel..just because it was free. the other meals in the restaurant were poor. wine list very poor and overpriced."
